### **What is Lockout Reimbursement?**

**Lockout Reimbursement** is a resident benefit that helps cover the cost of getting back into your home if you're ever locked out. If you lock yourself out of your home, Latchel will be on your side.

<Note>
  A resident can submit **one lockout benefit reimbursement** per year-long lease.
