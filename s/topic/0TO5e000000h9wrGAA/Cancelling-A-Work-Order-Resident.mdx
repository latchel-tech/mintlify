### **What happens when a work order is cancelled?**

- **Vendors are notified** (if applicable), so they’re aware that the job is no longer moving forward.
- **The task is closed out** in the Latchel system, and no further action will be taken.
- **No charges will be incurred** if the service has not yet been dispatched or completed.
- **The cancellation reason is logged** for internal tracking and reporting purposes.
