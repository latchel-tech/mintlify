### **How do I locate where my air filter(s) are in my home?**

1. Your air filter may be located next to your furnace or air conditioning handler. The handler is a metal box containing the fan and motor and can be found in the basement, attic, or closet. Once you locate the handler, you may find a spot where the filter will fit.
2. If you do not see a place for the filter, it is likely that you will place your air filter(s) at the return vents. Return vents are usually located in the wall or ceiling. Return vents are square or rectangular and larger than your regular air vents. The grate or cover can be opened and the filter will be inserted.

1. Check the size printed on your current air filter- The size will usually be printed on the side of the cardboard frame- You will see the nominal size (the whole number, i.e. 20" x 20" x 1") and an actual size (usually a fraction or decimal, i.e. 19.5" x 19.5" x .75").- We are looking for the nominal size.
2. If the size is not printed on the air filter, you can measure the existing filter using a tape measure.
3. If a filter is not in place, you can measure the air filter opening using a tape measure. We need the length, width, and dept.
