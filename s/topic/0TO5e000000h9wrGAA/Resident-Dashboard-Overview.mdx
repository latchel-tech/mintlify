#### Accessing Your Dashboard
Latchel is here to help with the coordination and scheduling of service requests. And you can do this as a resident by accessing your dashboard.

Access your dashboard via the email or text message you received from Latchel, after submitting your work order request. In the example below, you may click **View or Update Request**.

Once you're in the Maintenance dashboard, you will find all the work orders that you have requested through Latchel. These work orders are categorized depending on their statuses, such as **Action Required**, **Scheduled**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

* **Action Required** - Before the job is sent to the service provider Latchel is requiring action on your end to move the job forward.
* **Scheduled** – A job in the scheduled status means that we’ve already scheduled the arrival time for your service provider. These can be 1-hour to 4-hour time windows depending on your availability.
* **In Progress** – A job In Progress means that Latchel is waiting to get confirmation that work was completed by the service provider. At the end of the work date window, Latchel’s software automatically sends an SMS and an email to you and the service provider to confirm completion.
* **Done** – A job in the Done status means that the work has been completed.
