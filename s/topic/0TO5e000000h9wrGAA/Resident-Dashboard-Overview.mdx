<Tip>
  If it is your first time submitting a maintenance request and you haven't visited your Resident Maintenance Dashboard yet, feel free to **call or send an SMS** to **206-717-8374**. Our friendly Latchel Service Operation Associate will connect you and provide your **resident public URL dashboard**.
</Tip>

Then you will be directed to a work order page. Click the **My Maintenance** icon at the upper right-hand corner of your screen to access the Maintenance Dashboard.

Once you're in the Maintenance dashboard, you will find all the work orders that you have requested through Latchel. These work orders are categorized depending on their statuses, such as **Action Required**, **Scheduled**, **In Progress**, and **Done**.

- **Action Required** - Before the job is sent to the service provider Latchel is requiring action on your end to move the job forward.
- **Scheduled** – A job in the scheduled status means that we’ve already scheduled the arrival time for your service provider. These can be 1-hour to 4-hour time windows depending on your availability.
- **In Progress** – A job In Progress means that Latchel is waiting to get confirmation that work was completed by the service provider. At the end of the work date window, Latchel’s software automatically sends an SMS and an email to you and the service provider to confirm completion.
- **Done** – A job in the Done status means that the work has been completed.
