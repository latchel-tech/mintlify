description: "As a resident, you have access to your Resident Dashboard from where you can access your existing and past maintenance requests, and also submit a new maintenance request. This help guide will assist you on how you can submit a new maintenance request."
---

First, navigate to your dashboard by following the steps in the help guide:Â [**Resident Dashboard Overview**](https://help.latchel.com/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wrGAA/Resident-Dashboard-Overview).

<Note>
  If this is your first time submitting a maintenance request and you haven't visited your Resident Maintenance Dashboard yet, feel free to call or send an SMS to **206-717-8374**. Our friendly Latchel Service Operation Associate will connect you and provide your **resident public URL dashboard**.
</Note>

From your dashboard page, click the **New Request** icon located on the right side of the page.

On each subsequent page, please **answer the questions related to your concern** and **provide your availability**. Then, click the **Next Question** button to proceed to the following steps.
Once all the necessary information is provided, click **Submit Service Request**.
The work order will then be set to **"Pending"** status and will update you once a service provider confirms the appointment slot.
You can also click **View Work Order Details** to check the status of your requested work order.
