<Warning>
  The availability you set helps the service provider schedule an arrival time, **but it doesn’t mean the repair will only occur during that exact timeframe.**

  For example, if you list 10:00 AM–2:00 PM as your available time, the service provider may arrive at any point within that window and could continue working past 2:00 PM if the job requires more time.
</Warning>

And that's it! You've successfully updated your availability in your maintenance request.
