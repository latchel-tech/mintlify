### What is Ramp?

Latchel, Inc uses Ramp to manage their spend. Ramp is the only corporate card and spend platform designed and built to save companies time and money.

Through this secure platform, you can access your funds from Latchel for approved repair reimbursement claims.

### Reimbursement Claims Process

**Step 1: Filling the Reimbursement**

Start your reimbursement request by following the steps in [Resident Benefits: Filling for Cash Reimbursement](https://help.latchel.com/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wrGAA/How-can-Residents-Submit-Benefits-Through-Latchel)

**Step 2: Processing Timeline**

Once you submit your request, it takes approximately **5-7 business days** for Latchel to review and respond. Reimbursement approvals are processed every **Wednesday**.

**Step 3: Initial Response from Latchel**

After your request is reviewed, you will receive an email with a **welcome link to Ramp**. This email prompts you to provide your ACH bank details.&#x20;

**Step 5: Receiving the Approval Email**

Latchel will send an approval email based on the status of your ACH details:

* **If ACH details are missing:** The email will confirm your approval but indicate that your ACH details are required. You must use the Ramp link to add them.

Once approved, ACH processing takes an additional **3-5 business days** to deposit funds into your account.

### Heads Up!

  * **Reimbursement Limits:** Latchel reimburses up to **\$1,000** total—**NOT** a one-time \$1,000 receipt. The reimbursement is capped at **\$250 per incident** and applies per quarter.

  * **Ramp Link Expiration:** The Ramp link expires if no activity is detected by Latchel. Make sure to add your ACH details promptly to avoid delays.
