title: Overview of Work Order Life Cycle
description: Typically, emergency work orders are issues that could potentially cause property damage or pose an extreme habitability issue for the resident or the property; otherwise, it will be tagged as non-emergency. As a Property Manager, you can configure job severity and responsibility settings from your Latchel portal.

Once the maintenance request is submitted by either a resident or property manager and identified as a non-emergency, the system will source a Service Provider (SP) based on the prioritization queue through notification of SMS and email that a work order is available.

If the Preferred Service Provider accepts the work order, they can navigate to their dashboard to check on the work order details, resident/property information & location, options to send an estimate or proposal, and finally, set an appointment based on resident availability.

A confirmed appointment will place the work order in **Awaiting Work Date**. As soon as the work order is done, the service provider may mark the job as completed through the dashboard, and the property manager will be notified of the payment request.
