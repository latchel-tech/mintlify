<Info>
  **Note:** _These steps will only remove the service provider from the priority list of a skill category. If the same service provider is prioritized over other skills, they will remain prioritized. If you wish to remove the service provider from all categories, follow the steps in **[How to Remove a Service Provider (Globally)](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Remove-a-Preferred-Service-Provider-Globally)**_

On another note, there are situations when Property Manager would like to copy over company Service Provider prioritization settings to the portfolio or property level, but there are instances when they want to copy all company settings except for 1-2 skill categories. If they want to remove all the Service Providers in a skill category, it was very tedious to remove each Service Provider one by one.

Thanks to the continuous improvement that Latchel provide, the removal of all prioritized service provider from a skill category is now an easy job. Here's how:

From the property manager's profile, click on **Service Providers** then **Categories & Priorities.**

Scroll to the skill category where all service providers will be deprioritized. For this example, we have the **Solar category**. Click on the arrow to show all prioritized Service Providers.

The **Solar category** has 11 assigned and prioritized Service Providers. To remove the prioritization, click on **Remove All from Priority List.**
