<Warning>
  This option is only viable if Latchel is handling maintenance for **all units** in Rent Manager, as it applies a global change across the system.
</Warning>

### **Redirect Maintenance: Before Login to Rent Manager**

After disabling tenant access to create maintenance requests in Rent Manager, add a **login page banner** to redirect residents to Latchel. This ensures requests are submitted directly through Latchel for proper tracking and faster service.

Also under System Web Preferences, go to Tenant Web Access. Then click the pencil icon.

Then **add your personalized banner** as shown below. You can customize your banner however you like. Click **OK** to save.

<Tip>
  If you like to redirect customers to Latchel, just add your resident's work order URL by clicking **Insert Hyperlink**.
