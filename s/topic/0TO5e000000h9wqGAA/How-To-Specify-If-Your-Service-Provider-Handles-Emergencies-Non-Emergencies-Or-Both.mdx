_Please note that this setting is modifiable for the service provider and each trade (skill category) they are assigned. That means if you have a service provider that is prioritized for Appliance jobs and HVAC jobs, you will need to modify the job severity setting for the service provider under the Appliance skill category _**_AND_**_ the HVAC skill category. _**_This setting does not carry over to additional skill categories the service provider might be assigned to._**
