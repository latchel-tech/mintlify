### **Missing Properties & Residents in Latchel**

Give the Latchel user the permissions to the property. Do this by first going to the user’s management screen located in the setup menu on the **Admin** tab.

Check that this Latchel user has access to the location(s) we intend to service. Go to **My Integrations**. Look for **Latchel**, then click **Settings**. Check that this Latchel user has access to **All Locations** and **All Properties. **Then click**Save.**

Alternatively, if you only want us to receive certain properties, select the properties we are intended to service. You will not want to click **All Properties** if that is the case.

If only a certain property is missing, check that the property in Rent Manager is set to **Active**.

<Note>
  If the Service Issue in Rent Manager is assigned to a building with multiple units, it is required to assign the **unit** versus the property in order for it to sync to Latchel successfully.
