#### Missing Properties & Residents in Latchel


Give the Latchel user the permissions to the property. Do this by first going to the user’s management screen located in the setup menu on the **Admin** tab.

Check that this Latchel user has access to the location(s) we intend to service.

Check that this Latchel user has access to **All Properties.**

Alternatively, if you only want us to receive certain properties, select the properties we are intended to service. You will not want to click **All Properties** if that is the case.

Check that the property in Rent Manager is set to **Active**.

#### **Missing Work Orders In Latchel **


Make sure you assign the **\[Latchel\] Maintenance Category** to the Rent Manager Service Issue you wish to send to Latchel.

Check that there is a **property** or **unit** assigned to the Service Issue in Rent Manager.

If the Service Issue in Rent Manager is assigned to a building with multiple units, it is required to assign the **unit** versus the property in order for it to sync to Latchel successfully.
