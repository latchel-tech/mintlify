title: How to Add Warranty Information
description: "Adding information to this field will result in **ALL non-emergency work orders **(for that property) being automatically sent to you for approval and direction before dispatching occurs."
---

* **If after internal review you warrant Latchel should take over, you can request we coordinate the work order by messaging Latchel on the portal, [or by clicking **Take Action** on the work order and selecting “Reschedule This Job” which prompts Latchel to follow up on the maintenance request.](https://latchel.com/blog/take-action-when-work-order-is-placed-on-hold/)**
* No further action is required if you do not approve.


**NOTE:** _This will **not** prevent Latchel from dispatching emergencies. Latchel does **not** coordinate with Home Warranty companies. If there is an emergency at a property covered by a Home Warranty, Latchel will still try to resolve the emergency. If it can be de-escalated, Latchel will **not** send the work to the Home Warranty company on your behalf._

On the Latchel portal click the **Places** dropdown, then select **Properties**
