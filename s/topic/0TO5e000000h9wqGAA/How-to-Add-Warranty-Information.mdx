title: "How to Add Warranty Information"
description: "This guide explains how to add warranty information to a property in Latchel. When added, all non-emergency work orders for that property will be sent to you for approval before dispatching begins. Emergencies will still be handled by Latchel, but we do not coordinate with Home Warranty companies—any follow-up must be managed directly by your team."

<Warning>
  This setting **_does not_** apply to **_emergency situations_**—Latchel will continue to dispatch emergencies as needed. Additionally, Latchel **_does not_** **_coordinate_** with **Home Warranty companies**. In the case of an emergency at a property covered by a Home Warranty, Latchel will attempt to resolve the issue directly. If it can be de-escalated, we will not forward the request to the warranty provider.
</Warning>

On the Latchel portal click the **Places** dropdown, then select **Properties**

### **Escalating Work Orders with Warranty Info to Latchel**

If, after your internal review, you decide Latchel should handle the work order, you can request coordination by either:

- messaging us through the portal,
- clicking **Action** on the work order and selecting **Reschedule Work Order**. This will prompt Latchel to follow up on the request.

No further action is required if you do not approve.

And that's it\! You have successfully added the property's Warranty Information\!
