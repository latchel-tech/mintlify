title: How to Handle Tags for Someone Asking About Multiple Work Orders
description: "This functionality is applicable for when the person you are speaking with has questions about different work orders."

In these cases, it is important to split the conversation and ensure they each have the proper work order tags because 1) it'll make it easier to route them to the right people who can help them and 2) it'll be easier to reference them in the future.

There will be two scenarios where you will need to split and create a new conversation: 1) the person has questions about two different work orders and you are able to help them with both questions and 2) the person has questions about two different work orders and you are only able to help them with one of the questions.

1\. For Scenario 1, let's assume that you have already helped the person in the current conversation. You then ask if there's anything else that you can help them with. They respond Yes and you see that it's regarding a different work order than the one that you just helped them with. However, you have confirmed that you're able to still help the person with that other work order question.

* Click the **New Conversation Icon** ![image.png](/images/rtaImage-2-64.jpg) on the top right of the message box. This will then show you a modal that has a list of all the recent work orders that are related to the person you are chatting with. You can choose directly from this list or use the search functionality to search for a specific work order by **work order number**, **work order title**, or **property address**.
* After choosing the appropriate work order, it will then ask you **Do you want to handle this new conversation?**. For this scenario, since you are able to still help the person with this work order, you will choose **Yes, I'll handle it.**
    * Choosing this option will take you back to the SMS conversation so you can continue to help the person. You’ll notice that the work order tag in the header has been updated to the one you chose and there will also be an internal note letting you know that the tag has been updated.

2\. For Scenario 2, let's assume that you have already helped the person in the current conversation. You then ask if there's anything else that you can help them with. They respond Yes and you see that it's regarding a different work order than the one that you have just helped them with. You then confirm that you're unable to help the person with that other work order question because the work order is not within your portfolio.

* Click the **New Conversation Icon **![image.png](/images/rtaImage-2-65.jpg) on the top right of the message box. This will then show you a modal that has a list of all the recent work orders that are related to the person you are chatting with. You can choose directly from this list or use the search functionality to search for a specific work order by **work order number**, **work order title**, or **property address**.
* After choosing the appropriate work order, it will then ask you **Do you want to handle this new conversation?**. For this scenario, since you are unable to help the person with this work order, you will choose **No, I'll forward it to another PM**.****
    * Choosing this option will end the conversation on your end and then forward it as a new unread incoming SMS. For the next PM who ends up opening the forwarded SMS, the tag in the SMS window header will be updated to the one you chose and there will also be an internal system generated message that indicates that it's a forwarded conversation.
