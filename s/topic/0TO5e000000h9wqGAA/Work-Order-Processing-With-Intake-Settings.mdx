title: "Work Order Processing with Intake Settings"
description: "The **Work Order Processing** flow in Intake Settings determines how incoming maintenance requests are classified, routed, and resolved based on the rules you set. By using plain-language conditions, you control whether a work order is marked as **Emergency, Urgent, Normal, or Resident-Responsible.**"

### **How Work Orders are Processed**

1. **Resident Submits a Request**

- Residents enter issue details and answer any troubleshooting or follow-up questions configured in your Intake Settings.

2. **Troubleshooting Stage**

- The resident is guided through step-by-step troubleshooting to rule out simple fixes (e.g., checking circuit breakers or filters).
- Residents can provide plain-text responses, photos, and availability during this stage.

3. **Rule Matching**

- The request runs through your **custom Intake rules**, in order from top to bottom.
- When a rule matches, the system applies the classification you defined (Emergency, Urgent, Normal, or Resident-Responsible).
- If no rule matches, the request can be routed to a property manager for approval.

4. **Classification Outcome**

Based on the rule match, the work order is automatically categorized:

- **Emergency** → Immediate action required; dispatched quickly.
- **Urgent** → Prompt response, but not life-threatening.
- **Normal** → Standard maintenance timeline.
- **Resident-Responsible** → the work order is cancelled, the resident is informed they must coordinate and pay for the service themselves.

5. **Activity Log Transparency**

Each processed work order includes a log showing:

- The resident’s answers to troubleshooting questions.
- Which rule was applied and why.
- Any skipped rules and the reason they did not apply.
