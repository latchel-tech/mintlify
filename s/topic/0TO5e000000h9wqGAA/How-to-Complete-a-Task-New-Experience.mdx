<Info>
  **NOTE:** _If a work order is listed under this bin, it means that the work order has a pending task. Find the work order you need to work on and click it. You can also use the filters just right above the Action Required bin for easy searching._

Once you are on the Work Order page, there will be **two options** to review and action the open tasks.

**Option 1:** Notice the floating **Open Task reminder** in blue at the top right corner of the screen. From this option, you may click **View Details** or **Action**.

**Option 2:** Click on **Activity,** located on the left side of the page. For this help guide, let's use this option.
