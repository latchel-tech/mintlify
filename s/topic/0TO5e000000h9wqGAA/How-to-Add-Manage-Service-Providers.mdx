As a Property Manager, you can add your preferred service providers to your Latchel Portal. Once you add your service providers, you will be able to prioritize which preferred service providers that you want to use and the order of priority they should be used for each Skill Category.
 

## How to Add a New Preferred Service Provider


From your Latchel Portal, navigate to the **People** menu and select **Service Providers**.

Alternatively**,** you can select **\+ Add “Quick Create” Skill Set. **Three options will pop up:

We created pre-selected Handyman skills and General Contractor skills so you can quickly add skills Latchel has preset for these types of service providers.


You can choose the third option, **All Skills/All Trades** if you have a service provider who does everything.


Rest assured, if you select any of the 3 Quick Create Skill Sets, you can easily add/remove the skills we have preselected.

## How to Manage Service Providers and Their Skills

Under the **Service Providers **tab, click **Categories & Prioritization.**

On the left-hand side of the page, you will see a list of all Skill Categories and your preferred service provider within that category. Each service provider will have a number next to it showing their order of priority. 

A Property Manager or Admin can arrange the service provider prioritization by clicking **Edit Priority.** Six dots will appear beside the Service Provider name, and by hovering the mouse, the user may move the Service Provider position depending on their liking. To finalize the prioritization, click **Done Updating Priorities**.

For each of your preferred service providers, the user can see the contact information and all of the skills that have been prioritized to be used. As the Property Manager, you may choose to not use certain skills from certain service providers. 

To edit the skills, click the three dots assign to the service provider, and choose **Edit Skills**.
