In this scenario, you have determined that there is a difference between the work order tag and the actual work order that the person is sending a message about.

To Change this, click the **Edit Tag** under the work order title.

You will now see the list of the person's most recent work orders, and the search functionality.


To choose the work order mentioned, you can simply find the work order in the recent work orders list or use the search functionality. You have the option to search by **work order number**, **work order title**, or **property address**.

Once you found the work order that the person is sending a message about, click the (radio button) beside the work order. It will turn blue after you select it. Then, click **Next** to proceed.

Next, it will give you the option to keep talking to the person or to forward it to another Property Manager.


Choose the **Yes, I want to continue chatting** option if you are able to help the person with their question.


On the other hand, if the property assigned to the work order is not in your portfolio or if you're unable to help this person with their question, you can choose the **No, forward to another PM** option. This will end the conversation for you and then forward it as a new unread incoming SMS. For the next PM who ends up opening the forwarded SMS, the tag in the SMS window header will be updated to the one you chose and there will also be an internal system-generated message that indicates that it's a forwarded conversation.

You will be taken back to the SMS conversation with the person so you can continue to help them with their question. You will also notice that the work order tag has been updated to the one that you have just chosen.

There will also be an internal system message that confirms that the work order tag has been updated to what you chose.
