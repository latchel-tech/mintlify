In the event of running our software or data sync tools, if you come across a bug or if the tool gets stuck, please report it to us so we can continue to improve your experience with our product.

First, you will need to open your Property Management System to use the tool.

The Latchel data sync has a debug tool that inspects each action taken on a page and shows the issues found. To open that tool, click on the floating Latchel logo on your Property Management System dashboard and select "**download debug log**" from the dropdown menu.
