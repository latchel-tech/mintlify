The temperature settings will act as a threshold for determining if the temperature is too high or too low, depending on the property's location.

### **For AC Issues**

When a high temperature over 90 degrees is listed in the Emergency Temperature Settings for **_Insufficient cooling (high temperature)_**, it will be classified as an emergency according to the Severity Settings.

On the other hand, when a normal temperature ranging from 50 to 90 degrees is listed in the Emergency Temperature Settings for **_Insufficient cooling_**_ _**_(normal temperature)_**, it will be considered for approval based on the Severity Settings.

### **For Heating Issues**

When a low temperature below 50 degrees is listed in the Emergency Temperature Settings for **_InsufficientÂ heating_**_ _**_(low temperature)_**, it will be classified as an emergency based on the Severity Settings.

Similarly, when a low temperature below 50 degrees is listed in the Emergency Temperature Settings for the **_Heater not running (low temperature)_**, it will also be considered an emergency based on the Severity Settings.
