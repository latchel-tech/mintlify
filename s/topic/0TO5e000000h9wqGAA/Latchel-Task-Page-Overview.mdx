title: Latchel Task Page Overview
---


Latchel creates tasks when an action is required to move a job forward. Alternatively, tasks can be created by you and are for you and your team to manage action items.

**NOTE:** _Tasks are **not** meant to be created by you for the Latchel team. To request something from Latchel, please message Latchel Support directly. _

#### Action Required

At the center of your Latchel Dashboard, you will find the **Action Required** bin/bank which contains the open task.

#### Task Fields

Tasks start and live on work orders themselves. Let’s dive into what a task looks like on the work order page and what each field represents.

If you have tasks piled up, you will see the following categories: 

**Subject:** The subject will briefly summarize what action is required and why.

* E.g. Subject: **Follow-up to receive an estimate**
    1.  WHAT is a _“Follow-up…”_
    2.  WHY is _“…to receive an estimate”_


**Priority:** This will allow you to work on one task before another task even if they have equal age or severity, or even work on a higher priority task before an older task. Certain steps in the process are perceived as high priority (e.g. scheduling a service provider or responding to a budget increase request). This field will allow Latchel, you, or your team members to specify the importance of a task.
 

**Contact:** The contact field will allow you to route work based on the contact type. When you view or set this field, keep in mind who the blocker is and who this task is about. Contact types include:
 

1.  Property Manager
2.  Service Provider
3.  Resident
4.  Owner


**Assigned User Group: **This field represents the group of users that were notified of this task. **[Click here to learn more about user groups and how to determine the assigned user group for the property.](https://latchel.com/how-to-create-user-groups/)**

**Assignee:** You can choose to assign a task to yourself or another user as long as they are a part of the assigned user group. This field will help narrow down tasks when utilizing the filtering options from the Task Bar.

**Scheduled For:** This is the date the tasks should be completed. Once this date passes, the task will be considered _overdue_.

**Description: **Task descriptions are the details about what exactly needs to be done and should contain any additional detail or context.

#### Task Bar Filters 

The Taskbar features filtering options that will allow you to customize the tasks that display. To expand the Task Bar filtering options, click on the filters section.

**Due:** Here, you can select to view all tasks or just your overdue tasks. Tasks are considered overdue if the “scheduled for” date set on the date has passed. We advise you to review overdue tasks first.
 

**For: **This will allow you to filter tasks for jobs (work orders) or for invoices.
 

**Sort: **You may select to sort tasks by
 

* Priority – _Refer to the Task Fields > Priority section above. _We advise you to start with this sorting option first. The highest priority tasks will be sorted first.
    * Sorting by priority sorts by priority, then severity, then age
        * i.e. Priority = priority, then severity, then age
* Severity – This is the job severity (Emergency, Urgent, or Normal). If you select this sorting option, the tasks open for Emergency jobs will be sorted first.
    * Sorting by severity sorts by severity, then priority, then age
        * i.e. Severity = severity, then priority, then age
* Age – This refers to the age of the task. If you select this sorting option, the oldest tasks will be sorted first
    * Sorting by age sorts by age, then severity, then priority
        * i.e. Age = age, then severity, then priority
