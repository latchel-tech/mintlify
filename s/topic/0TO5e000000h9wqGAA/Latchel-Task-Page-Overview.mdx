title: "Latchel Task Page Overview"
description: "The Task Page in the Latchel Dashboard gives you a streamlined view of all open work orders that require action from your team. Each task is clearly categorized, making it easy to prioritize what needs attention—whether it's approving a proposal, reviewing an invoice, or responding to a vendor. Use the filter options to sort tasks by type, status, or urgency, so you can quickly take action and keep operations moving smoothly."

Latchel creates tasks when an action is required to move a job forward. Alternatively, tasks can be created by you and are for you and your team to manage action items.

<Warning>
  Tasks are not meant to be created by you for the Latchel team. To request something from Latchel, please message Latchel Support directly.

### **Task Fields**

Tasks are created and managed directly within work orders. The Tasks page provides a centralized view of all tasks associated with your company across various properties. You can filter the displayed tasks using the filter options on the left side of the screen.

If you have tasks piled up, you will notice that each task is categorized with a subject line that briefly summarizes both the action required and the reason behind it. 

For example, a subject might read: **"Follow-up to receive an estimate."** In this case, **"Follow-up"** indicates what action is needed, while **"to receive an estimate"** explains why the task exists. This format helps provide quick clarity on both the nature and the purpose of the task at a glance.

### **Task Filter**

The filter section helps you to narrow your search of the task you are looking for and to allow you to customize the tasks that display. By default, it will show the overdue tasks for work orders, sorted by priority. 

You can adjust each of these filters based on your needs. The **Due** field can be set to either **Overdue** or **All**. The **For** field can be changed to **Work Order** or **Invoices**. Lastly, the **Sort** option allows you to organize tasks by **Priority**, **Severity**, or **Age**.

The **Priority** setting allows you to prioritize one task over another, even if they share the same age or severity. For example, high-priority actions—such as scheduling a service provider or responding to a budget increase request—can be addressed ahead of older or equally severe tasks. This field enables Latchel, you, or your team members to designate the relative importance of each task.

In addition to the main filter options, you can further narrow your search by selecting specific criteria from the following filters:

- **My Groups:** This option is available if your company settings include different user groups assigned to each property or portfolio.
- **Assignee:** Use this filter to display tasks assigned to a specific individual.
- **Portfolio:** Filters the task list to show only properties under a specific portfolio.
- **Property:** Displays tasks associated with specific properties. A property will not appear in the list if it has no open tasks.
- **Contact:** Shows all users or contact persons who have open tasks, along with the number of tasks assigned to each.
- **Contact Type:** Allows you to filter tasks based on the type of contact — Vendor, Property Manager (PM), Resident, or Owner. It also shows tasks that are not currently assigned to any contact.
