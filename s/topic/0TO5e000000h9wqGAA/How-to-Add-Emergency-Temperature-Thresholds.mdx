title: "How to Add Emergency Temperature Thresholds"
description: "This guide explains how to set emergency temperature thresholds in your Latchel account. These thresholds help ensure that temperature-related issues—like heating or cooling failures—are treated as emergencies when conditions fall outside of safe limits for residents."

### **4 Temperature Settings**

**A. Standard** **Settings** _(Healthy Individuals)_

1. Low Temperature
   - This is the lowest temperature before you consider heating issues an emergency **(Latchel Default: 45°F)**
2. High Temperature
   - The highest temperature before you consider air conditioning issues an emergency **(Latchel Default: 95°F)**

**B. Infants, Elderly, Disabled Settings**

1. Low Temperature
   - This is the lowest temperature before you consider heating issues an emergency **(Latchel Default: 55°F)**
2. High Temperature
   - The highest temperature before you consider air conditioning issues an emergency **(Latchel Default: 85°F)**

<Note>
  The local temperature shows up on the job page in Latchel. If there is a day in the week that will meet an emergency threshold, we show the thresholds and highlight the day in the red.
