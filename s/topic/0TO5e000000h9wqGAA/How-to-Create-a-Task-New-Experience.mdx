They should be used to describe future actions that will be taken by your internal team, owners, preferred vendors, or residents to progress the work order. Both existing and newly created tasks will automatically appear on the Task Page."

To create a task, from your Latchel dashboard, go to the **Maintenance tab** and click on **Work Orders**.  Search and select the work order that you want to add it to. Use the Search Bar then click on the Work Order ID.

You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters** option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the **Filter**, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page.**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page)
