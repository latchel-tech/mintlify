First, from the dashboard, click on the **Maintenance tab**, and open the work order by either searching and/or clicking the specific order number. You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters** option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the Filter, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page.**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page)

On the work order page, click **Invoices**. Then click the **download icon** across the invoice you need to download. Once done, the invoice is saved on your computer downloads.

Another option is to go to the **Invoices** tab located at the top of the page. From there, you can search for the work order ID by entering either the **invoice number**, the **work order ID**, or the **property address**. Additionally, with the new experience, you can also find the work order by entering an estimated invoice amount you want to download.

For this example, we will search for the invoice using an **estimated amount**. From the list of invoices that appear, make sure you are downloading the invoice from the correct property address. Click the **download icon** on the right side of the page, aligned with the correct property address.
