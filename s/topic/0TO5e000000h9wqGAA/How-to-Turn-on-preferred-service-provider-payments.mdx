Turning this on ensures any invoices that are submitted for service providers that are opted in or have a payment method set up will be processed through the Latchel Pay system.

<Warning>
  If the service provider does not have a payment method set up, you won't be able to turn the preferred service provider payment option on.
</Warning>

Furthermore, turning **ON Latchel Service Provider Dispatch & Payments** would allow Auto-Assign Latchel Vendor Network to get paid.
