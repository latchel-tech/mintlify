### **Action Required Section**

These are work orders that the Latchel system detects as being “in trouble” and needing the attention of you or someone at your company. Specifically, work orders will show up in this section IF

- The work order has an open ‘task.’
- The task is assigned to you or someone at your company
- The work order is “open” (i.e. not Cancelled or Completed)

From the Main Dashboard, you can sort the work orders depending on the time duration status (**Shortest/Longest**). You could also filter it by **Portfolio**, **Owner**, **Users**, and **Severity**.
