title: "Projects & Unit Turns"
description: "Whether you're managing a routine unit turn or overseeing a large-scale renovation, Latchel’s Projects feature gives you everything you need to stay on top of progress, budget, and documentation—all in one clean, organized view.
With Projects, you can easily group related work orders, track completion, and centralize important files so nothing falls through the cracks. From the moment you create a project, you’re set up to link it to properties, add due dates, and monitor work with complete clarity. You’ll also be able to spot which work orders belong to projects with clear visual indicators right from your dashboard.
This guide will walk you through how to create and manage projects step by step, so you can turn unit turns into smooth transitions and renovations into wins for your team and your residents."
