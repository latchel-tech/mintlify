Please note, that there are main skill categories which is the field on the left-hand side (e.g.Plumbing, HVAC, Appliance) and then there are skills within the category (e.g.connecting dryer vents, clearing drains, etc.) which is the field on the right-hand side. We'll show you how to update both options below:

Choose the Category by clicking one of the listed items in the drop-down menu.

By clicking a category, a list of other skills will pop up. You can select a better-fitting skill for the work order from the dropdown list.
