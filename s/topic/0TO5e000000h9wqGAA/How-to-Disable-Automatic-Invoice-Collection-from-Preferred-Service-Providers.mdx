title: "How to Disable Automatic Invoice Collection from Preferred Service Providers"
description: "Let’s explore how the Invoice Collection feature works in this help guide."

### **How This Works**

- When Invoice Collection is **disabled**, Latchel won’t request invoices from your Service Providers, assuming they’ll send them directly to you. 
- When **enabled**, Latchel sends daily automated SMS reminders to collect the invoice.
- When the request for the invoice is sent, Latchel also creates a task for the PM for **Awaiting Invoice**.

### **Invoice Notification Frequency**

Latchel asks the Service Provider for the invoice **every day for 3 days** and then **every week for 3 weeks** and then **once a month for 3 months.**

### **Managing Invoice Collection Feature**

On your Latchel Dashboard, select **People** from the top navigation menu and then click on the **Service Providers.**

Locate the **My Service Provider Management** and click on the hyperlinked name of the Service Provider to be taken to their profile.

Under **Work Order Settings**, toggle **Invoice Collection** **OFF**. Once the toggle is grayed out (the toggle will be positioned to the left), invoice collection is turned off for the preferred vendor.

Please feel free to toggle this back **ON** if you want Latchel to ask your preferred Service Providers for an invoice.
