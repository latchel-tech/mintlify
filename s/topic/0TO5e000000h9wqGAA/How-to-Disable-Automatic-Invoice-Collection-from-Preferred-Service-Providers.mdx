title: How to Disable Automatic Invoice Collection from Preferred Service Providers
description: "By disabling Invoice Collection, Latchel’s automation will **skip** asking your preferred Service Providers for an invoice. We assume they’ll send them to you directly. Alternatively, if you choose to enable Invoice Collection then Latchel will **attempt** to collect an invoice from your Service Provider by sending a daily automated SMS message for 5 days."

Latchel asks the Service Provider for the invoice every day for 3 days and then every week for 3 weeks and then once a month for 3 months.

When the request for the invoice is sent, Latchel also creates a task for the PM for Awaiting Invoice.


On your Latchel Dashboard, select **People** from the top navigation menu and then click on the **Service Providers.**

Locate the **My Service Provider Management** and click on the hyperlinked name of the Service Provider to be taken to their profile.

Under** Work Order Settings**, toggle Invoice Collection **OFF**. Once the toggle is grayed out (the toggle will be positioned to the left), invoice collection is turned off for the preferred vendor.

Please feel free to toggle this back **ON** if you want Latchel to ask your preferred Service Providers for an invoice.
