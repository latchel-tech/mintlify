description: "Latchel’s integration with Rentvine makes property maintenance easier by syncing work orders, tenant info, and property details between both systems. This means no more double entry—just smooth, automatic updates so you can focus on managing properties while Latchel handles the maintenance coordination. Use this guide to help you understand how the integration works and make sure Rentvine and Latchel stay in sync."

### **Integration Requirements**

To begin your Rentvine integration with Latchel, you'll need to obtain your Rentvine credentials or API keys. Please follow the steps below to retrieve this essential information.

The Latchel engineering team will need 3 pieces of data:

1. API key
2. API secret
3. Customer subdomain. This subdomain is found in the URL of your portal. It is the first bit after "https://".  In the screenshot below, the subdomain is "demopm5".

### **Obtaining the Rentvine Credentials**

Follow these steps to setup an API Key.

Login to Rentvine, navigate to **Settings**\>**Account**\>**User, Roles and API Keys**.

</Frame>

Go to Api tab, then click **New API Key**. Enter **“Latchel”** as the **Name** and select **“Administration”** as the **Role**. Then click **Save**.

### **Get Property and Resident Data from Rentvine**

This step is only necessary if you already have existing property and resident records in Latchel. 

<Warning>
  To proceed with assigning reference IDs to your existing data in Latchel and avoid creating duplicate records, you must follow the steps below to export two CSV files:

  1. Lease Tenants Report – This report includes the Property ID and Unit ID.
  2. Tenants Report – This report includes the Tenant ID.

  **<u>Both reports must be downloaded before continuing.</u>**
</Warning>

1. **Lease Tenants Report**

Download the csv reports. First, export report of Lease Tenants. Go to **Reports**, search for "**tenants**" to show both **Lease Tenants**, and **Tenants**.

Export the property report with Property ID, and Unit ID by choosing **Lease Tenants**. Then click **Build Report**.

  ![Reports Lease Tenants 05 22 2025 07 32 AM Pn](/images/Reports-Lease-tenants-05-22-2025_07_32_AM.png)
</Frame>

Then click **Columns**, make sure to **check the boxes** for **Property ID**, and **Unit ID**. Click **Export**, and save it on your computer as prompted.

</Frame>

2. **Tenants Report**

Obtain the Tenant ID by going to: **Reports \> Tenants**. Choose only **Active** tenants, then click **Build Report**. Make sure the **Tenant ID** column is selected, then click **Export** to download the report.

Finally, forward both of these reports to your Customer Success Manager or the Latchel Product Support team by emailing [team@latchel.com](mailto:team@latchel.com) or [success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com). You may include your API keys in the same email for convenience.

### **What happens when a customer first activates their integration?**

When an admin first activates the customer’s Rentvine integration nothing happens immediately. The integration will be active and will be scheduled for hourly imports.

**A. Properties**

The following Property fields are brought over from Buildium to Latchel.

| **Buildium Field** | **Value/Interpretation in Latchel** |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| PropertyId         | ref_property_id                     |
| UnitId             | ref_unit_id                         |
| address            | address1                            |
| address2           | address2                            |
| city               | city                                |
| stateID            | state                               |
| postcalCode        | zip                                 |
| blank              | criticalNote                        |
| unit.isActive      | property.is_active                  |
| name, unit name    | integration_data                    |

  **Automatic Property Reconcillation**

  To ensure accurate customer billing Latchel runs on automated process each month to de-activate any active units in Latchel that no longer exist in Buildium. This process currently happens on the 27th at 3am PST. Learn more of how this works by going to [How Latchel Integration Works](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-Latchel-Integration-Works).
</Check>

<Note>
  When a property is **deactivated** through the reconcillation process, it will be logged to the property in Latchel as:

  ![Image 20231219 185054 05 21 2025 12 39 PM Pn](/images/image-20231219-185054-05-21-2025_12_39_PM.png)
</Note>

**B. Residents**

The following resident fields are synced from Rentvine to Latchel. Currently, we sync all eligible residents during each sync. All residents on a property are included to ensure that any of them can submit a work order in Latchel.

| **Rentvine Field** | **Value/Interpretation in Latchel** |
| :----------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| contactID          | ref_user_id                         |
| name               | name                                |
| email              | email                               |
| phone              | Primary phone number\*              |
| propertyId         | ref_property_id                     |
| unitId             | ref_unit_id                         |
| Move In Date       | move_in_date                        |
| Move Out Date      | move_out_date                       |

<Note>
  **Previously-created residents**

  Once a resident is created we only change a few things on subsequent syncs:

  - Property/unit associations
  - Move in / move out dates
    - When a resident is passed their move-out date, we’ll mark them **inactive** at the relevant property in Latchel.
</Note>

**C. Work Orders**

Unlike properties and residents, which only sync from Rentvine to Latchel, work orders sync both ways—Rentvine to Latchel and Latchel to Rentvine.

- **Rentvine → Latchel**

The Rentvine integration syncs work orders that have been created in the last 72 hours.
