Such synchronization will be triggered **ONLY** when the work order is moved to any of the below states on the Latchel console:

- Completed 
- Canceled
- Forwarded to PM

The file classification content can be also synced to PropertyWare and presented in the **Description field** of the file record. The available classification to sync includes:

- Miscellaneous
- Work Order
- Before Image
- After Image
- Image Receipt
- Estimate
- Invoice (the invoice file, not the invoice receipt)
- Null (no classification is assigned o the file)

There is no limitation to the file format for the sync. However, PropertyWare might use an alternative name to present the file format while Latchel portal doesn't show anymore what type of File has been uploaded.

If the Latchel user moves the work order from the state of Completed, Canceled, or Forwarded to PM to another state and adds a new attachment then, he/she will see only the newly added attachments to be synced once the user moves the work order back to Completed, Canceled, or Forwarded to PM again.
