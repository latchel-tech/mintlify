The goal is to respond promptly - when a RentCheck inspection reveals a maintenance problem, an immediate work order is created in Latchel. By leveraging the specialized capabilities of RentCheck and Latchel's robust work order system, this partnership ensures faster, more effective response times for maintenance-related rental property concerns. This, in turn, reduces downtime, increases resident satisfaction, and ensures a higher rate of long-term lease retention.
