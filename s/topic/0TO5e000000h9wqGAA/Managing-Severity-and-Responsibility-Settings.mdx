title: "Managing Severity and Responsibility Settings"
description: "Severity and responsibility settings help define how different types of maintenance issues should be handled—whether they require immediate attention and who should take action. This guide explains how to review and adjust these settings to align with your property management preferences."

### **Severity and Responsibility Settings and It's Effect in your Work Orders**

When a job needs approval, it will go into the status:

1. **Needs PM Approval** (if you are on the Home Assistant or Premium plan)
2. Otherwise, it will go to **Forwarded to PM.**

Whenever a work order enters the **Needs PM Approval** status, the following notifications are triggered:

1. Latchel will create a task for the assigned user group.
2. When it is between 8 am - 7 pm (property time), Latchel will send a text to the user group.
3. After 24 hours, Latchel will send a reminder email to the user group.

<Tip>
  To know more about managing user groups, follow [How to Create User Groups](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Create-User-Groups).
</Tip>

In addition to pre-approval, you can also configure job severity and responsibility settings from your Latchel portal. Please note, if you mark something as resident-responsible, you are saying that the resident is responsible for these costs and Latchel should bill the resident (this setting should only be used if you are on the Home Assistant program).  If you mark a job as normal, urgent, or emergency, this will indicate the job is the Property Manager’s responsibility.

- **Needs Pre-Approval**: Approval of new non-emergency maintenance requests is required before Latchel dispatches a Service Provider
- **Resident’s Responsibility** **_(Home Assistant Plan Only):_** The tenant will be responsible for paying for this job. Latchel will coordinate these jobs and charge the resident through the Latchel portal if the resident is enrolled in the Home Assistant program
- **Normal**: Non-emergency
- **Urgent**: Scheduled in 72 hours
- **Emergency**: Dispatched immediately

By keeping these settings up to date, you can ensure Latchel is taking the right action for newly created work orders.

### **How to Update Severity and Responsibility Settings**

In the same way as setting up the portfolio, you can override the property's current severity and responsibility settings.

<Warning>
  Overriding the settings at the property level supersedes the severity and responsibility set at the portfolio and company levels. Any changes made at the portfolio or company level will no longer apply to the property once it has been individually updated.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Any changes made to your severity and responsibility settings on your account settings page will only apply to future work orders. If you need to update existing work orders created prior to the change, you will need to modify them individually. For more information, refer to [How to Change the Severity Settings on a Work Order](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Change-the-Severity-Settings-on-a-Work-Order).
</Note>

### **How to Set a Severity Settings Fallback**

**Severity Settings Fallback** is used when a work order doesn’t match any existing preset. It allows you to set a default response for how Latchel should handle such cases.

From your Severity and Responsibility page, click the **dropdown arrow** next to Severity Fallback and **select** either **Needs Approval** or **Emergency**.

- If set to **Needs Approval**, all new work orders without a matching severity preset will notify the assigned property manager, and the work order will require their approval before proceeding.
- If set to **Emergency**, Latchel will automatically treat unmatched work orders as emergencies and take over handling them.
