#### **Severity and Responsibility Settings and It's Effect in your Work Orders**


When a job needs approval, it will go into the status:

1.  **Needs PM Approval** (if you are on the Home Assistant or Premium plan)

2.  Otherwise, it will go to **Forwarded to PM.**



Whenever a work order enters the **Needs PM Approval** status, the following notifications are triggered:

1.  Latchel will create a task for the assigned [user group](https://latchel.com/how-to-create-user-groups/)

2.  When it is between 8 am - 7 pm (property time), Latchel will send a text to the [user group](https://latchel.com/how-to-create-user-groups/)

3.  After 24 hours, Latchel will send a reminder email to the [user group](https://latchel.com/how-to-create-user-groups/)



In addition to pre-approval, you can also configure job severity and responsibility settings from your Latchel portal. Access **[this link](https://t.sidekickopen70.com/s2t/c/5/f18dQhb0S7kF8cp3bcW1LV9l959hl3kW7_k2841CXdp3VNxyhz7t5LznW2dykf73nJ1lr101?te=W3R5hFj4cm2zwW3zfPSj3ZSzDSW3Q_1PK3Fbt5SW3z8PWD41pRdGW3FbtRY4ff6S7W4kCJnS4fQQR6W3K9dj741Y7cnF3T0vnnW1v91&si=8000000001867425&pi=53a4d45e-9ea0-4786-a729-34490b14244a)** to view your account pre-approval, severity, and responsibility settings. Please note, if you mark something as resident-responsible, you are saying that the resident is responsible for these costs and Latchel should bill the resident (this setting should only be used if you are on the Home Assistant program).  If you mark a job as normal, urgent, or emergency, this will indicate the job is the Property Manager’s responsibility.

* **Needs Pre-Approval** = Approval of new non-emergency maintenance requests is required before Latchel dispatches a Service Provider
* **Resident’s Responsibility** _(Home Assistant Plan Only)_ = The tenant will be responsible for paying for this job. Latchel will coordinate these jobs and charge the resident through the Latchel portal if the resident is enrolled in the Home Assistant program
* **Normal** = Non-emergency
* **Urgent** = Scheduled in 72 hours
* **Emergency** = Dispatched immediately

By keeping these settings up to date, you can ensure Latchel is taking the right action for newly created work orders.
