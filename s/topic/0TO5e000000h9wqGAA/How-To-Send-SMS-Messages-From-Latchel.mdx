title: "How To Send SMS Messages From Latchel"
description: "This guide walks admins or property managers through how to send SMS messages directly through a work order in Latchel. All messages are sent from your designated **Latchel Communication Phone Number**, which you can view in your account under **Maintenance Communication Settings.** Using SMS helps strengthen customer communication and keeps everything tied to the work order."

<Tip>
  This is a different number than your [Latchel-Assigned Phone Number](https://help.latchel.com/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-view-your-Latchel-Assigned-Phone-Number), which is given to residents to submit work orders.
</Tip>

### **Initiate an SMS Conversation**

From the work order page, the resident section is located at the center. Click the corresponding **SMS icon** of the resident that you want to contact.

<Warning>
  Please remember that if you cannot send an SMS message to someone, check the SMS icon to see if the number is valid or textable. A red icon will appear next to the number if at any point we attempt to send an SMS message to that user and the message fails to be delivered.\
  \
  This can happen if the number is a landline, disconnected, etc. When this happens, we mark it as an undeliverable message to prevent any new messages from being sent to it. If the number is invalid as such, please escalate the issue to our Customer Success team by emailing [success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com).
</Warning>

### **Open Incoming SMS Messages**

From the top right corner of your dashboard, click the **SMS icon**.

### **Closing/Ending SMS Messages**

Click on the ellipse on the right-hand side of the SMS interface to **End the Conversation**, or **Close Window**.

You may choose **End Conversation** if you are still waiting on a reply but would like to completely close out the SMS conversation. This will also unassign the team member that had been working on it previously.

If you choose **Close Window**, this option is to close the conversation window in your portal but leave it active. This option leaves the conversation assigned to you and allows you to access or return to it later.

<Check>
  Close Window keeps the conversation assigned to the team member who last responded. And when a new SMS comes in, the messages will be automatically assigned to you.
