<Info>
  **NOTE:** _Please remember that if you cannot send an SMS message to someone, check the SMS icon to see if the number is valid or textable. A red icon will appear next to the number if at any point we attempt to send an SMS message to that user and the message fails to be delivered. This can happen if the number is a landline, disconnected, etc. When this happens, we mark it as an undeliverable message to prevent any new messages from being sent to it. If the number is invalid as such, please escalate the issue to our Customer Success team by emailing [success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com)._

Click on the ellipse on the right-hand side of the SMS interface to **End the Conversation**, or **Close Window**.

If you choose **Close Window**, this option is to close the conversation window in your portal but leave it active. This option leaves the conversation assigned to you and allows you to access or return to it later.

<Info>
  **NOTE:** _Close Window keeps the conversation assigned to the team member who last responded. And when a new SMS comes in, the messages will be automatically assigned to you._
