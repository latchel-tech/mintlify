</Frame>

Select the file from your computer and click **Open.**


<Frame>
  <img src="/images/rtaImage-289.jpg"/>
</Frame>

Once the file is uploaded, it will appear under **Attached Files.** Under Classification, choose the type of file to identify what type of file is uploaded.

You may choose from the following options:

* Miscellaneous
* Work Order
* Before Image - the image of the site before work is done
* After Image - the finished result after work is done
* Invoice Receipt
* Estimate

For this example, we will choose After Image.
