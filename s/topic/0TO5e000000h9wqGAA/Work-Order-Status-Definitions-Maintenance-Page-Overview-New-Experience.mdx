#### **Work Order Status Guide:**

**Troubleshooting** – A work order in the Troubleshooting status indicates that the Latchel team is currently investigating and resolving the issue with the residents. It is important to note that a maintenance request should never be in the Troubleshooting status for a vacant unit. This status is reserved **for emergency work orders only**.

As a property manager, you will have limited access to interact with a work order in the Troubleshooting status. This is because our team is actively working on resolving the issue and may not see your updates until they have completed the troubleshooting process. If you need to contact our team while a work order is in the Troubleshooting status, please use the **Message Latchel Emergency Team** button provided in the email notification you received when the work order was created.

See this guide on how to contact Latchel: **[How to Contact Latchel](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Contact-Latchel)**

**Finding Service Provider** – A Work Order in Finding Service Provider status means that we’ve completed troubleshooting the request and have determined that a service provider must be dispatched. This means we will begin dispatching immediately or in the morning. We dispatch immediately in cases where there is potential property damage or an emergency occurs during normal business hours. Otherwise, we may defer dispatching until business hours to help reduce the potential service charge.

**Scheduling with Resident** – Before the work order is sent to the service provider Latchel will gather the resident’s availability first. They may also provide access to enter if they cannot be home.

**NOTE:** _This step will be skipped if the property is marked vacant!_

**Scheduling with Service Provider** – Latchel has alerted the service provider of the work order and requires the service provider to set a confirmed work date using the residents' availability. (Unless the property is marked vacant or permission to enter was granted by the resident.)

**Awaiting work date** – A Work Order in Awaiting Work Date status means that we’ve already scheduled the arrival time for the service provider. These can be 1-hour to 4-hour time windows depending on the availability of the service provider and when the emergency takes place.

**Confirming Completion** – A Work Order in Confirming Completion status means that Latchel is waiting to get confirmation that work was completed by the service provider. At the end of the work date window, Latchel’s software automatically sends an SMS and an email to both the service provider and the resident to confirm completion.

When a job enters this status a notification is sent to both the service provider and the resident (if present) through SMS and e-mail prompting them to confirm the status of the work order.

* If it's an **emergency**, a notification is sent to the resident. This is to give the resident a chance to tell us if the issue returns or was not completed. If it hasn't been confirmed complete, a task is created after 2 hours to confirm the completion with the resident.
* If it's a **non-emergency**, the resident, and the service provider are given 24 hours to confirm, otherwise, a task is created for the admin to confirm from both the resident and the service provider the status of the work order.
* If the **service provider is a Latchel Contracted Network**, a task is created for the admin, otherwise, the work order is automatically marked as complete and moves to collecting the invoice after another 24 hours. (48 hours total)

**NOTE**: _The job moves to **Awaiting Invoice** or straight to **Complete** based on the service provider's billing settings. Check this guide to know more: **[How to Set the Required Detailed Invoice Setting](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Set-the-Require-Detailed-Invoice-Setting),** and **[How to Disable Automatic Invoice Collection from Preferred Service Providers](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Disable-Automatic-Invoice-Collection-from-Preferred-Service-Providers)**_

* If the resident does not respond to all the notifications, then the work order automatically moves to Awaiting Invoice. The resident still has an opportunity to provide feedback even after the work order is completed.



**Awaiting Invoice Receipt** – A Work Order in Awaiting Invoice status means that Latchel is waiting for the service provider to create their invoice for work. Latchel only reaches out to your preferred Service Providers for 5 days before closing out a work order. Our workflow automation assumes that your preferred Service Providers will send the invoice directly to you if they don’t create it on our software within 5 days. We automatically send them a notification asking them to send the invoice directly to you. 

Our software automates a daily update SMS and email message to service providers. When service providers access their dashboard, they may upload or create an invoice.

For your preferred Service Providers, we send an SMS and email every 24 hours. On day 5, we automatically SMS them asking them to send the invoice directly to your team.

<Info>
  **NOTE**: _We expect your preferred Service Providers to work directly with you on invoicing and payment processing if they do not respond to Latchel’s texts or emails._
</Info>

Latchel guarantees invoice submission for Latchel Contracted Network service providers (LCN).
