### **The Budget Limit: Emergency vs. Non-Emergency**

#### **Emergency Service**

The **Emergency Soft Budget Limit** is shared with Service Providers when a job is sent to them. If a job will exceed the Soft Budget Limit then the Service Provider contacts Latchel first for approval.

The **Emergency Hard Budget** **Limit** is the maximum budget limit that you allow Latchel to approve up to. For example, assume a soft limit is \$200 and a hard limit is \$500. The Service Provider contacts Latchel when the job will exceed \$200. Latchel will automatically approve the cost if it is below \$500. Anything over \$500 will be escalated using your escalation contacts list for approval.

#### **Non-Emergency Service**

The **Normal Soft Budget Limit**is the default budget limit shared with Service Providers when a job is sent to them. If a job will go over the Soft Budget Limit then the Service Provider contacts Latchel first for approval.

The **Normal Hard Budget Limit**is the maximum budget limit that you allow Latchel to approve up to. For example, assume a soft limit is \$150 and a hard limit is \$250. The Service Provider contacts Latchel when the job will exceed \$150. Latchel will automatically approve the cost if it is below \$250. Anything over \$250 will be escalated using your escalation contacts list for approval.

### **Customizing Budget Limits (Property Level)**
