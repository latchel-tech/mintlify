The purpose of using the Latchel Integration is to save the property managers time and improve the overall quality of service through efficiency.

Let's take a look at this example:

### **A Process Without Latchel Integration**&#xD;&#xA;

### In this scenario, the property manager (let's call him Bob) has two systems. He uses different software to manage leases, residents' communication, & owner and property information. He uses Latchel to track and manage maintenance. Here are some of the challenges Bob is going to have to manage:

* Bob’s company has a policy of keeping any historical information about a property in their main software. That means Bob has to manually copy/paste WO details, pictures, and files from Latchel to the software. Ew!

* If anything about Bob’s residents changes, lease dates, contact information, etc. Bob has to make these updates in TWO places! If he doesn’t, operational issues can occur.

* Similarly, if any property or owner information changes, Bob also has to make sure he executes these changes in two places. Gross!

### **A Process With Latchel Integration**&#xD;&#xA;

### Here, Bob uses the same software plus the Latchel Integration, they work seamlessly together to keep Bob’s operations running efficiently and with less tedious work. With the same example as above, work orders, pictures, and files are automatically synced from Latchel back to Bob’s primary software. Easy!

* If Bob makes any changes to resident data in his main software, the changes are automatically reflected in Latchel an hour later.

### **What types of data can be synched between Latchel and platforms?**

The below table is the general data that can be synched between platforms:

### **How often Does Information Sync between the system?**

Sync timing depends on the exact integration platform but is aligned in general to the following.

**Platform to Latchel**

* When a customer first activates their integration, full synchronization of all of their properties and residents is triggered automatically.

* After that, scheduled syncs occur every hour, on the 5-minute mark (e.g. 08:05 AM).

  * Scheduled syncs can take 45 minutes to complete

  * Only data updated in the previous 72 hours is considered

**Latchel to Platform**

* Work orders are generally synced on the creation

* Files are synced when the WO is completed
