### **What's New\!**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always-On Auto Sync" defaultOpen icon="clock" iconType="duotone">
    No need to manually sync your data—syncing now happens automatically every 4 hours as long as you're logged into AppFolio and the Latchel extension. You can still run a manual sync if needed, but it's no longer required for regular updates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Refreshed User Interface" defaultOpen icon="bullhorn" iconType="duotone">
    The extension now has a cleaner, more modern look with a simplified layout. All the familiar settings are still available but tucked into an organized overflow menu.

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clearer Sync Status" defaultOpen icon="magnifying-glass-arrows-rotate" iconType="duotone">
    Easily see when your last sync happened. If it's been less than 24 hours, you’ll see how many hours ago it occurred. Otherwise, you'll see the full date and time of the last sync.

    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Smarter Sync Experience" defaultOpen icon="arrow-down-arrow-up" iconType="duotone">
    Most syncs now happen quietly in the background. The only time your AppFolio screen might be briefly blocked is when syncing work orders from Latchel to AppFolio. You’ll get a 30-second heads-up (with the option to snooze) before this happens.

      ![Snooze 04 29 2025 10 55 AM Pn](/images/snooze-04-29-2025_10_55_AM.png)
    </Frame>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fewer Distractions" defaultOpen icon="do-not-enter" iconType="duotone">
    Previously, errors from failed syncs were shown in the extension. We’ve removed this to avoid confusion. Instead, those sync issues are automatically sent to the Latchel Data Support team, who troubleshoot them behind the scenes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Easy Issue Reporting" defaultOpen icon="toolbox" iconType="duotone">
    Having a problem? You can now report it directly through the extension. Your report will automatically create a support ticket and send helpful debug information to our engineers—speeding up the time it takes to find a solution.
