title: "Emergency Escalations: Property Damaging and Extreme Habitability Situations"
description: "This guide is designed to clarify when a Latchel Associate will escalate issues to the property management company’s emergency contacts."
---

While Latchel handles various emergencies, there are situations where we will not escalate to the property management company's emergency contacts. These include non-damaging issues, routine maintenance, and situations that do not pose immediate risks to property or habitability. Understanding the specific scenarios that warrant an emergency escalation will help ensure a smooth and efficient resolution process, and alleviate any confusion regarding the types of emergencies that will prompt a call from us.

### **Defining Property Damaging, and Extreme Habitability**

- **Property Damage** is defined as any potential issue that is likely to cause continued physical damage to an otherwise non-damaged item or portion of the home, i.e. if the issue is left unresolved, the damage to the property will increase over time. With that, the longer it takes to resolve the issue, the bigger the damage will become and thus more expensive to fix.
- **Extreme Habitability** is defined as an issue that represents the loss of a major service or a potential safety issue.

### **Property Damaging and Extreme Habitability Issues**

1. **Plumbing or Any Water Leak Issues**

These are defined as intense leak, filling more than a bucket a day, and are not going into a drain. This also applies to leaks where the source is unknown (e.g. resident hears a leaking sound) or cannot contain/mitigate the leak. These include:

- roof leaks
