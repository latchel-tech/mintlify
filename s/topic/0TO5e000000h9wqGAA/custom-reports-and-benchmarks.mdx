title: "Latchel Analytics: Custom Reporting and Benchmarks Usage Details"
---

This guide details the usage of **Custom Reporting and Custom Benchmarks for Analytics+** subscribers, including how report slots are consumed for initial requests and annual maintenance.

### **Custom Reports**

Every Analytics+ subscription comes with 3 custom reports. A general overview can be found by accessing the link below.

To summarize, an Analytics+ customer can request **3 new reports or changes to existing reports** **or maintain up to 3 custom reports** while they’re subscribed to Analytics+. Customers who need more reports can design a package by talking with our Sales Team. Reach out to Customer Success to begin scoping a custom package.

In the following table, **“report”** is used as shorthand for any of the following:

- Data report (like a .csv file with many data fields)
- Single data point KPI or metric
- Graphs or charts

The Initial Request column shows how many reports the request is equivalent to (e.g. a complex report is equivalent to one simple report). The Annual Maintenance column shows how many report slots are consumed each year to maintain your past reports. You can request to turn off old reports at any time, but re-opening them will count as a new report.

| **Request type**                       | **Initial Request** | **Annual Maintenance** |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------- |
| A new report                           | 1                   | 1                      |
| A new complex report                   | 2                   | 1                      |
| A simple change to an existing report  | 1                   | -                      |
| A complex change to an existing report | 2                   | -                      |
| A new custom benchmark                 | 2                   | 1                      |
| An AI Analysis data field              | 1                   | 1                      |
| Historic “snapshot” data storage       | 2                   | 1                      |

<Note>
  So for example, if in your first year you request 1 data report that contains an AI insight and then after a few months decide you want to edit that report, you would have used your usage allotment for the first year. In the following year, that report and data insight would use up 2 report slots to maintain, leaving you with 1 available report or change request for that year.

<Tip>
  If you want more custom reporting, then **talk to Customer Success** to discuss designing a custom pricing package for additional custom reporting.

### **Additional FAQs**

1. **I notice that sometimes my historic data changes when I view my scheduled report each month. Why is that?**

<Check>
  Most often historic data is based on the timestamp that things were most recently updated. For example, if a work order is closed in one month and later re-opened, it may shift from one month to another. Metrics based on when a work order was created should remain stable, but metrics based on when work orders were updated are expected to shift month over month as work orders are re-opened or updated.

  If having completely stable, point in time data is important, you can request custom data storage to take a snapshot of the historical data and lock that data in time so it does not shift. This is equivalent to a new complex report.

2. **What kind of AI Analysis can be performed?**

<Check>
  This analysis is for running a Large Language Models (LLM) against your data. This can help determine things like analyze free-form text for common themes, identify anomalies, make recommendations, understand sentiment, infer root causes and more. It’s important to note that overloading a single AI prompt can result in reduced performance. Sometimes multiple AI Analysis fields are required to have a high quality output.
</Check>

3. **Can a report contain an AI Analysis?**

<Check>
  Yes. We typically see these AI Analysis fields used in .csv style reports with an output of one or multiple AI Analysis fields. However, we can also build single AI Analysis reports to analyze other data output, such as anomaly detection and explanation in a chart. When there are AI Analysis fields within a report, the total report maintenance cost is increased by the number of AI Analysis fields in the report.
</Check>

4. **Is there a limit to how complex a report can be?**

<Check>
  No. We can support up to research-grade statistical analysis and highly complex AI models. However, the scope of a single complex request cannot be infinite. More than 90% of requests we’ve received in the past are simple requests and of the remaining “complex” requests, fewer than 5% are extremely complex. This means less than one half of one percent of requests are beyond the scope of what we mean by “complex.” If you are requesting something extremely complex that actually requires multiple complex reports to be built, we will scope it out and tell you how many reports it will take to build before proceeding.
