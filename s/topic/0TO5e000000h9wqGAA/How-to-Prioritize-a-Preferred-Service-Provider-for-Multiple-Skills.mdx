Previously, all categories must be checked one by one to add the skills to the service provider. Say goodbye to this because there is now an option to **Check All Categories.Â **This saves more time and effort in updating, changing, or managing your preferred service provider's skills. Simply click **Check All Categories** and viola! All subskills will be checked!

* to the **TOP** priority for all of their skill category
* to the **BOTTOM** priority for all of their skill category


Click **Prioritize** to save the changes you made.

<Info>
  **NOTE:** _Prioritizing service providers for multiple skills can be done via Property Manager Profile and Admin access on Company, Property, and Portfolio levels. As an admin or property manager user, it is best to check first the inheritance setup to understand where the changes could be applied._
