#### **Scheduling with Service Provider Status**

<Info>
  **NOTE:** _The floating section at the upper right corner will give you the suggested action depending on the state of the work order, which will address the issue in just 2 clicks. If the action you need is not in the floating section, just click the Hide button._

When you select **Schedule Now**, a pop-up window will appear and from there you can see the **Work Date** availability which is editable by clicking the **date and time**. Place any notes if there are any in the **Additional Details** field (this is completely optional). Once you are good with the set date and time, you can simply hit the **Submit** button below.

If the resident or service provider does not respond to the automated SMS or email regarding their schedule availability, we can initiate the work order to be rescheduled. At this point, an admin or the property manager must take over and reach out to the resident or service provider directly to confirm a schedule that works for everyone involved.

It's important to have a clear and efficient process in place for scheduling maintenance or repair work, as delays can be frustrating for all parties and may impact the overall quality of service. By having a dedicated admin or property manager who can step in and coordinate with residents and vendors, we can ensure that work orders are completed as quickly and smoothly as possible.

<Info>
  **NOTE**: _For efficient scheduling, residents should share their availability with service providers, allowing for a suitable appointment time to be chosen._
</Info>

The **Remind Service Provider** option will simply send an email and/or SMS to the service provider. The message can be edited, and if the content suits your needs, click **Send**.

#### **Set Status to On Hold**

A work order that is in **any status aside from Cancelled or Completed** can be put on hold by simply clicking the **Other Actions** button and choosing **Put This Work Order on Hold**.

You will be prompted to **Select a Reason** for putting the work order on hold. You can either select **Waiting for Materials, Waiting for Owner Approval, or Pending**. Make sure you fill out all the information needed as shown in the picture below.

If you need to pause the job cycle or temporarily stop automated notifications, you can put the work order on **Pending**. There are several reasons why you might want to do this, including:

* **A service provider request:** the provider may need to wait for access or resolve internal issues with the resident or property manager.
* **A trigger from the resident:** the resident may report that the job is not yet resolved.
* **A property manager request:** the property manager may want to forward the job to their team or the owner.
* **System trigger:** the system may detect a similar job and need to confirm if it's a duplicate or a new issue.

While the job is on hold, it's essential to have an open task and an assignee actively working on it so that it can resume once the issue is resolved.

#### **Set Status to Completed**

Next is setting the work order to **Completed**. If all of the issues in the property were taken care of, then on the floating section at the upper right corner select **Confirm Work Completion** and hit **Submit**.

Some of the work orders that are not in the **Confirm Completion** status can also be set as **Completed**. Just click the **Other Actions** and hit the **Mark This Work Order as Completed**.

Then select the appropriate field and hit **Submit**.

Once we receive confirmation from both the service provider and the resident that the job is complete, we can place the work order in the **Completed** category. The Preferred Service Provider can even mark the job as completed on their end and upload the invoice right away. However, for our **Latchel Contacted Network Service Providers (LCN)**, it's important to wait for confirmation from the resident before marking the job as complete. This ensures that all parties are on the same page and that the work order is fully wrapped up.


#### **Set Status to Cancelled**

Finally, we have the option to cancel a work order by placing it in the **Cancelled** category. This can be necessary in certain situations where the work order cannot be completed as planned, and it ensures that everyone involved in the process is aware of the cancellation.

At the right top corner of the work order page click the **Other Actions** and choose the **Cancel This Work Order** option.

Then indicate the reason why the work order should be canceled and hit **Submit**.

**A work order can be canceled at any point during its journey for a variety of reasons.**

* The Property Manager may request cancellation at their discretion.
* The Resident may request cancellation if the issue is no longer present
* Latchel may also cancel the work order if an investigation reveals that it is no longer required.

When changing a work order status, it's important to have a solid reason or basis for doing so. This helps ensure that the job can be completed successfully and efficiently.
