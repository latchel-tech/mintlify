When you defer a task for a later date or time, it’s like hitting the snooze button on an alarm clock. The alarm or new task due date will sound at a later date and time that you specify. Depending on the unique circumstances of a job, the job task may need to be deferred. 

<Note>
  You will only see the option to defer a task if that task is **overdue**.
</Note>

With the New Work Order Experience, if an open task requires attention, a **floating Open Task box** will appear in the top right corner of the page. Notice that, you’ll immediately see what help is needed and what action you need to take. You may click the **View Details** option to check the details of the open task, then it will take you directly to the **Activity** tab giving you more details of the open task that needs your immediate attention.

<Tip>
  The **Action** button on the same page gives you an option to take action on the work order by changing the current status of it. To know more about this visit, [How to Take Action When a Work Order Is Pending](https://help.latchel.com/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Take-Action-When-a-Work-Order-Is-Pending-New-Experience).
</Tip>

On the **Edit Task**, an admin user, or a property manager will have the option to adjust the due date of the task by clicking on the calendar and choosing the new due date of follow-up.

We advise adding a **deferral reason** to the notes section. When the task is expanded, any task deferral notes will be underneath the original task note. Task deferral reason is an important part of taking effective notes for the team.

Once the comment is accomplished, click on **Save**.
