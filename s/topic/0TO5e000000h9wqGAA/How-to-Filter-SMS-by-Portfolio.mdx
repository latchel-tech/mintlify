<Info>

**NOTE**: _The **Message Unrelated to a Portfolio** option is for incoming SMS where the system was unable to designate a work order tag, or it's from a phone number that has not been verified within the Latchel system._

</Info>
Once you are back on the Message field you will notice that the Filter icon has no slash, meaning there is an active filter applied.
