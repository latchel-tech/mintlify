The information on the list view is:

- Created Date
- Work order
- Title
- Service Provider
- Address

The Work Order page can be changed from **List view** to **Kanban view** by choosing the icon right beside the search work orders.

The **Kanban view header** will provide different work order statuses together with their corresponding color. The aim of the color-coded work order statuses is for property managers and owners to have a sort of visual clue about how Latchel works and find the Latchel dashboard easier to navigate. Here's more information about the work order color scheme:

Filters are also available for easier order management. The applied filters are saved with a specific URL so that the property managers can bookmark or save the filter page.

Work orders can be filtered by:
- All Time (allows you to filter the work orders depending on the date or range of dates that you will set.)
- All States: All orders status
- Portfolios
- Owners
- Time in State: Shortest or longest time in state
- Archived: Hidden or Show
- Emergencies


<Info>
  **Note:** _Clear Filters is also available to reset the previous filter setup._

Aside from the **Work Order** tab, property managers or administrators can also view the work orders in various contexts such as on the **Resident**, **Property**, **Portfolio**, and **Owner** pages.Â And Latchel now "**remembers**" user filters on these pages!

From any of the mentioned pages, go to the **Maintenance** tab and the work orders will show the same view and features from the main Work Order page.

In addition, users can now search for work orders from any page in Latchel!

The work order search navigation feature can be seen at the upper right side of the portal.

Upon clicking the work order search bar, the five most recently updated work orders will appear in the dropdown. To find a specific work order, search by the property address or any other related details.

There are two ways to utilize this search work order tool. The first is by selecting from the results shown in the drop-down after entering the details in the field. The second is by clicking **See all results**, which will navigate to the Work Order page, displaying the results of the initial search.
