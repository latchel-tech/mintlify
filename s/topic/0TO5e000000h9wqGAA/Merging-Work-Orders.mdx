title: "Merge Work Orders"
description: "The **Merge Work Orders** feature allows property managers to combine duplicate or related **non-emergency work orders** at the same property. This feature addresses situations where property managers receive multiple work orders at the same property that can be handled by the same service provider. By merging these work orders, managers can avoid sending multiple dispatches and prevent being charged more than one trip fee for issues that can be resolved in a single visit."

**Open the work order** you want to merge. From the **Action** dropdown, choose **Merge Work Order**.

### **When Can a Work Order Be Merged**

A property manager can merge a new work order (child) into an existing one (parent) if:

- Both work orders are **active** at the **same property**.
- The work orders are **non-emergency**.
- The new work order **doesnâ€™t have a Service Provider assigned**.
