In duplicate check, the work order will be placed on a pending state (Needs Approval), and as the Property Manager, you will have to either **Deny**, or **Approve** and re-schedule the work order.

Option 1: On the right side of the work order page, you will notice a pop window that says **This work order requires your approval. Click on Approve.**

Regardless of the options selected, the Property Manager has the authority to either Approve or Deny the work order. Upon choosing to **Approve**, please add a note, specify the approved budget, and click **Submit**. This will initiate the scheduling process for the work order.
