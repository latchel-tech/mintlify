title: "How Emergency Temperature Works with Intake Settings"
description: "With Intake Settings, property managers can define when a temperature-related issue, such as an air conditioning or heating problem, qualifies as an emergency. Instead of relying on a fixed definition, you can set your own plain-language rules that take outside or inside temperature into account."

  **Why Temperature Rules Matter**

  - **Avoid unnecessary emergency dispatches** for minor comfort issues.
  - **Ensure resident safety** when extreme temperatures pose health risks (e.g., infants, elderly, or medical conditions).
  - **Save costs** by only classifying true emergencies that require immediate attention.

### **How to Set the Temperature Rule**

If you’d like HVAC work order severity to vary depending on outside or inside temperature, you can set that directly within your Intake Settings rules.

Go to the **Intake Settings**, then **edit or change** your current set rule.

From your list of existing rules, you can edit any temperature rule, or add a new one if none exist.

In the **Edit Rule** box, write a rule that specifies when a heating or cooling issue should be considered an emergency. Set the **outcome to Severity: Emergency**, then click **Save** to finish. Refer to the example rule text below for guidance.

Once done, you can also set the order for the new temperature rule.

### **Resident Experience**

- When submitting a request, residents are prompted to enter the current temperature.
- If their answer meets the emergency condition you defined, the work order is automatically classified as **Emergency**.

### **Work Order Processing**

- Intake Settings compares the resident’s response with your rule.
- If conditions match, the work order is flagged as emergency and processed immediately.
- If conditions don’t match, it continues through the rest of your rules until a match is found.
