title: "How Emergency Temperature Works with Intake Settings"
description: "With Intake Settings, property managers can define when a temperature-related issue, such as an air conditioning or heating problem, qualifies as an emergency. Instead of relying on a fixed definition, you can set your own plain-language rules that take outside or inside temperature into account."

  **Why Temperature Rules Matter**

  - **Avoid unnecessary emergency dispatches** for minor comfort issues.
  - **Ensure resident safety** when extreme temperatures pose health risks (e.g., infants, elderly, or medical conditions).
  - **Save costs** by only classifying true emergencies that require immediate attention.

Define Your Temperature Settings

To set your temperature thresholds (Low and High) for Standard, as well as for Infants, Elderly, and Disabled, go to **Account Settings** and expand **Emergency Temperature Settings**. Once finished, click **Save**.

The temperature settings will act as a threshold for determining if the temperature is too high or too low, depending on the property’s location.

### **How to Set the Temperature Rule**

Following your defined temperature settings in your Account Settings page, write a rule that specifies when a heating or cooling issue becomes an emergency.

Go to the **Intake Settings**, then **edit or change** your current set rule.

From your list of existing rules, you can edit any temperature rule, or add a new one if none exist.

In the **Edit Rule** box, write a rule that specifies when a heating or cooling issue should be considered an emergency. Set the **outcome to Severity: Emergency**, then click **Save** to finish. Refer to the example rule text below for guidance.

Once done, you can also set the order for the new temperature rule. 

### **Resident Experience**

- When submitting a request, residents are prompted to enter the current temperature.
- If their answer meets the emergency condition you defined, the work order is automatically classified as **Emergency**.

### **Work Order Processing**

- Intake Settings compares the resident’s response with your rule.
- If conditions match, the work order is flagged as emergency and processed immediately.
- If conditions don’t match, it continues through the rest of your rules until a match is found.
