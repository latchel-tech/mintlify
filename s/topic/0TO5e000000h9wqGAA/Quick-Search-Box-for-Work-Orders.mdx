Besides the conventional search from the maintenance page, users can now perform a work order search from anywhere within the dashboard. Conveniently located, the work order search can be found in the upper right section of the dashboard display.

### **How To Search for a Work Order**

Simply type in any details about the work order, such as the property address, work order number, or title, and it will automatically generate a list of possible related work orders based on the details you entered.

If the search result does not provide the work order you are looking for, you can also click **See all results**, which will take you directly to the **"Maintenance"** page. From there, you can use the **Filter** to refine your search!
