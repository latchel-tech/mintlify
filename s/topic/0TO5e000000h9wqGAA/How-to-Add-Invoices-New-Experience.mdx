From the dashboard, click on **Maintenance**, and open the work order by either **searching and/or clicking the specific order number**. You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters** option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the **Filter**, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page.**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page)

Once on the work order page, notice that the work order status is **Awaiting invoice receipt.** To add the invoice, click on **Add Invoice** shown in the top right notification on the page.

Once you follow the steps and upload the invoice to the work order, you'll see the status of the work order change to **Completed**. The uploaded invoice will be nested under the **Invoice** tab on the work order page.

In addition, when the work order status is  **Awaiting invoice receipt**, aside from adding an invoice, there's an exceptional status called **Remind Service Provider**. This status is used to nudge the Service Provider to send us the required document for the work order, which includes an invoice.

To send a reminder, click on **Remind Service Provider.**

A pop-up box will appear, displaying a standard message that we send to the Service Provider via email or SMS. This message encourages them to review the work order so progress can be made. If needed, you can tailor the message to request a more specific action from the Service Provider, then simply hit  **Submit**.

One more option available for the Property Manager is to complete the work order without uploading the invoice. 

From the work order page, **Awaiting invoice receipt**, click on **Other Actions** and choose **Complete Work Order without Invoice.**

A new pop-up box will appear where you have the option to add a description note. This can explain why the order needs to be set as completed without an invoice. Once done, just click on **Submit**.
