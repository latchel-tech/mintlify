title: "Approvals"
description: "Approvals are a powerful way to stay in control of your maintenance workflow while keeping things running smoothly for residents and owners. In Latchel, approvals let you decide what gets done, when, and by whom—without all the back-and-forth. Whether you're greenlighting work orders, reviewing budgets, or looping in owners for big decisions, our flexible approval settings give you the oversight you need without slowing things down. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the three types of approvals available in Latchel, how to manage them from your dashboard, and how to tailor the experience to fit your team’s workflow. We’ll also cover smart budget controls, automatic invoice approvals, and how to keep owners involved—only when you want them to be."
