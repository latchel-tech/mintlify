You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters**  option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the Filter, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page).

From the work order page, click on the **Details** tab and scroll to the **Additional Information** section. If you do not want the resident to cancel the work order, leave the toggle for **"Resident has ability to cancel this work order"** turned **OFF**. Doing so will prevent the resident from canceling the work order and mark it as mandatory.

And as easy as that\! The resident will no longer have the option to cancel the work order\!
