You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters**  option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the Filter, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page).

From the work order page, click **Details**. Look for the **Additional Information** portion. If you do not want a resident to cancel a work order, you can toggle the option "**Resident has ability to cancel this work order**" to **ON**. Enabling this option will prevent the resident from canceling the work order otherwise, it can be cancelled anytime.Â

And as easy as that\! The resident will no longer have the option to cancel the work order\!
