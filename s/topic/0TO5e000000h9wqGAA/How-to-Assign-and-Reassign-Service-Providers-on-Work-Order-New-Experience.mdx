If you cannot secure your preferred Service Provider for dispatch, you can access Latchel's list of Service Providers to expedite things. Scroll down to the bottom of the pop-up page and click **Search for Latchel Service Provider**. If you don't see this option, follow these [**steps**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Opt-Into-the-Latchel-Contractor-Network) to opt-in to this feature.

**Note:** **_Latchel’s list is a valuable resource for building up your preferred network. Pro-tip: Contact them beforehand to discuss the scope of work needed before hiring._**

#### **Reassigning/Manually Changing a Preferred Service Provider**

This scenario is when a Property Manager or Latchel Admin is manually changing a Preferred Service Provider on a work order.

When you want to change the Service Provider on a work order, go to the Service Provider section of the work order page and click the ellipsis. Then click **Edit SP**.

The user will then see a modal that lists the currently selected Preferred Service Provider company at the top with an orange label that says **This Service Provider is currently assigned to this work order**. In order to switch the user to the same Preferred Service Provider Company, select that Service Provider company.

The next modal screen will show you the Preferred Service Provider company with a drop-down of users at the company. Click the drop-down and choose whichever user you’d like to assign to the work order. Leave a note summarizing why you are changing the service provider. Lastly, click **Add to Work Order** to submit the change.
