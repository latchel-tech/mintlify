Please note that by making this change, Latchel Contracted Network service providers will no longer be assigned to work orders of any type. This may occasionally require your involvement to keep work orders moving forward smoothly. **_All work orders where the list of Preferred Service Providers has been exhausted, will be forwarded to the assigned property manager._**


In case you need to opt out from Latchel Contracted Network from specific portfolio or a property follow these steps below!

#### **How to Opt-Out a Portfolio**

If you opt a portfolio out of the Latchel Contractor Network, this means that the properties added to the portfolio WILL NOT be serviced by the Latchel Contractor Network. To learn more about configuration inheritance and how a portfolio can override company-level configurations, read **[Configuration Inheritance (Property, Portfolio, & Company Level)](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/Configuration-Inheritance-Property-Portfolio-Company-Level "Configuration Inheritance (Property, Portfolio, & Company Level)")**.

On your portal click **Places** and on the dropdown select **Portfolios**.

#### **How to Opt-Out a Property**

If only a particular property from your company or from a portfolio must be opted out from LCN, follow the steps below. Please take note that changing the settings within a property do not affect the settings of the portfolio (if the property is assigned to a portfolio) or the company. Check how this works from this help guide: **[Configuration Inheritance (Property, Portfolio, & Company Level)](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/Configuration-Inheritance-Property-Portfolio-Company-Level)**

Search for the property from your dashboard. Go to **Places**, then select **Properties**.

Please note that by making this change, Latchel Contracted Network service providers will no longer be assigned to work orders of any type. This may occasionally require your involvement to keep work orders moving forward smoothly. This means that _**for portfolios or properties that are opted-out from LCN, the work order will be forwarded to the property manager if the list Preferred Service Providers has been exhausted.**_
