### **High-Level Overview**

* Latchel will contact escalation contacts once, then leave a voicemail if no response.

* Only the designated escalation contacts will be called. If you need to customize your escalation contacts, please refer to the help guide:Â [How to Update Your Escalation Contacts.](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Update-Your-Escalation-Contacts)

* Latchel will only escalate situations that pose immediate risks to property or habitability. For more details, please refer to [Emergency Escalations: Property Damaging and Extreme Habitability Situations](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/Emergency-Escalations-Property-Damaging-and-Extreme-Habitability-Situations). Please note that for any scenarios outlined in the latter help guide, the escalation contact list will be called at any time of the day.
