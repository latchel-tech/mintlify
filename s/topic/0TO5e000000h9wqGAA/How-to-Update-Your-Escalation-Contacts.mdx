title: "How to Update Your Escalation Contacts"
description: "You can provide an escalation path through your defined contacts in the event that an emergency request needs to be escalated. You can add multiple contacts to this field, in the order in which you want the contacts to be called. We will call each contact 3 times and leave a voicemail before sending a final email."

  Before proceeding, it's important to understand how each property—or a portfolio—can inherit settings from its portfolio or company-level configurations. To learn more about configuration inheritance and how a single property can override portfolio and company-level settings, see [**Configuration Inheritance (Property, Portfolio, & Company Level).**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/Configuration-Inheritance-Property-Portfolio-Company-Level)

### **4 Common Scenarios When Latchel Escalates Cases to You**

There are 4 cases when Latchel may escalate emergency issues to you:

1. There is an instruction to follow the escalation path in the pre-dispatch instructions.
2. The job should be de-escalated based on your severity settings but Latchel believes it to be property damaging.
3. Latchel was unable to secure a vendor for an emergency issue. If it is a night or weekend, we only call the escalation contacts if the issue is property damaging and an extreme habitability issue. Otherwise, defer the call to the next morning. 

   <Tip>
     To understand the specific scenarios that warrant a call to escalation contacts for emergencies, visit [Emergency Escalations: Property Damaging and Extreme Habitability Situations.](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/Emergency-Escalations-Property-Damaging-and-Extreme-Habitability-Situations)
   </Tip>
4. In a worst-case scenario, the property suffers catastrophic damage. For example, a fire burns down part of the home, or a car drives through a wall. This type of catastrophic structural damage will result in Latchel immediately escalating to the escalation contacts.

In the event that we can’t get in touch with any of your escalation contacts, we’ll send a final email to your escalation email list. We will provide all the details relevant to the job, provide an avenue for you to contact our emergency team, and close the work order in our system until we hear back from you (_This is the worst-case scenario)_.

<Warning>
