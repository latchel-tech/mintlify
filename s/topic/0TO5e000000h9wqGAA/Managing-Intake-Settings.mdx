Then, edit the rule by writing a plain-language rules that describe how the issue must be classified. **For example:** _"AC issues are only emergencies if outside temperature is above 90°F"_ or _"If the AC brand is LG, classify as emergency regardless of temperature."_

Next, select the **Outcome**. This sets the severity of the rule you determined. You can choose from the following options:

- **Severity: Normal**
- **Severity: Urgent**
- **Severity: Emergency**
- **State: Needs Approval** - When a rule is set to this state, the work order will require your approval as the property manager before it can proceed.
- **Stop: Resident Responsible** - When a rule is set to this outcome, the job will be automatically canceled.
