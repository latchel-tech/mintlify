### **The Previous State**

Previously, property managers had to configure more than 140 severity settings and temperature thresholds to manage different work order cases.

### **What is Harmonia?**

Harmonia is the system that **replaces Severity/Responsibility Settings and Emergency Temperature Settings**. It processes the property manager's custom intake rules, and the outcomes of those rules are logged directly on the work order under Intake Processing Details.

### **Harmonia Features**

- Write custom rules in plain language to define what should be an emergency, non-emergency or require your approval before dispatching
- Test your rules by entering any maintenance issue
- Easily create, edit or delete rules based on your desired intake outcome
- Apply custom rule sets at the company, portfolio or property-level for maximum customization

### **What is Harmonia X?**

Harmonia X **replaces the point-and-click diagnostic flow** by generating dynamic questions and troubleshooting suggestions based on the property manager’s Intake Settings (Harmonia). The responses are then fed into Harmonia to determine the appropriate work order severity and skill.

### **Harmonia X Features**

- Residents enjoy an intuitive intake experience based on their PM’s Intake Settings and the specific responses they provide at each step of the flow.
- Residents are guided through basic troubleshooting aimed at de-escalating their work order severity.
- Determines Work Order Skill.
- Spanish language supported (residents just need to type a free-form response in Spanish to launch the Spanish experience).

<Note>
  Note that our team will get you set up with a default rule set. From there, you can edit, add, or delete rules in that set based on your preferences, or create new rule sets for specific portfolios/properties. These rules will guide and determine your residents’ intake experience and how work orders are processed at intake
