Here's how you can add a special note to any work order:

To select the desired work order, from the dashboard, click on the **Maintenance tab**, and open the work order by either **searching and/or clicking the specific order number.** You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters** option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the Filter, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page.**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page)
