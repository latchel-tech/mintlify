The on-call rotation depends on the product package setup. So, you need to make sure that your company has subscribed to the _**ER-SaaS-RBP package**_ and that the _**Include On-Call**_ is toggled on. If not, reach out to Latchel for assistance.

Once you have subscribed you can set up the On-call rotation. From your portfolio dashboard, go to the **On-Call** tab, then hit **Create One** to start the setup.

You can also move them up and down using the **Arrow** or remove them using the **Trash** icon corresponding to each of the technicians.

Select a **Backup Contact **in case the technicians are unable to be contacted.

But in the instance that the technicians or the backup contacts do not respond, you can also set up a **Final Contact Group** or just leave it as None.

  **NOTE:** _Make sure that the **service provider** that you want to include on the On-call rotation is **set up with In-House Billing**. Check **[Navigating Your Preferred Service Provider's Profile](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Navigate-Preferred-Service-Providers-Profiles)** for the steps on how you can set this up._
