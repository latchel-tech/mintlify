The on-call rotation depends on the product package setup. So, you need to make sure that your company has subscribed to the **_ER-SaaS-RBP package_** and that the **_Include On-Call_** is toggled on. If not, reach out to Latchel for assistance.

Once you have subscribed you can set up the On-call rotation. From your portfolio dashboard, go to the **On-Call** tab, then hit **Create One** to start the setup.

You can also move them up and down using the **Arrow** or remove them using the **Trash** icon corresponding to each of the technicians.

But in the instance that the technicians or the backup contacts do not respond, you can also set up a **Final Contact Group** or just leave it as None.
