### **How does Latchel handle payments for Service Providers?**

When a service provider submits an invoice, Latchel follows different procedures to ensure payment, depending on whether the provider is a **Preferred Service Provider, LCN (Latchel Contact Network) Service Provider, or a Latchel Vendor Network Service Provider (LVN).**

- **Preferred Service Provider:**

Latchel acknowledges receipt of the preferred service provider's invoice and informs them that payment will be issued by the Property Manager/Company.

- **Latchel Contracted Network (LCN):**

First, Latchel confirms completion of the job by checking with the resident or requesting before-and-after photos from the Service Provider.

Second, if the job is confirmed completed, the operation associate must understand if the LCN Service provider is an **Issued Card Service Provider** or **LCN Direct Deposit Service Provider**

For **Issued Card Service Providers**, if the job is under \$500, Latchel can issue payment immediately. For amounts over \$500, a task is created for the Payment Processing group to handle, and process the payment. 

For **LCN Direct Deposit Service Providers,** Latchel requests that the service provider submit their invoice via the Latchel dashboard, after which payment will be processed automatically.

<Note>
  For Property managers/companies who opt-in to use Vendor Provider Networks, Latchel will use the service provider payment method to pay Vendors sourced through our partner network based on the saved payment method in the property manager's/company profile.

- **Latchel Vendor Network Service Provider (LVN)**

LVN service providers are a direct deposit type of service provider. Once they have completed the job, they are required to submit their invoice, after which the amount that was approved for the job will be processed automatically.

### **Who is notified if a new invoice is added/uploaded?**

Once a Preferred Service Provider, LCN, or Latchel Vendor Network uploads or submits an invoice, Latchel automatically sends a notification to the Property Manager to alert them of the new invoice.

### **How is the Property Manager notified when a Service provider uploads an invoice?**

The Property Manager is notified through email when a service provider uploads an invoice. Additionally, the invoice will also appear in the work order and can be viewed in the **"Invoices"** tab of the work order.
