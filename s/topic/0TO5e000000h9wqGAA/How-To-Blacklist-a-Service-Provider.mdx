title: How To Blacklist a Service Provider
---

Blacklisting a service provider is a useful option for a Property Manager Company that no longer wishes to work with a particular provider but wants to ensure that other PM companies can still maintain their relationships with that provider. By blacklisting the provider, the PM Company can prevent them from being assigned to jobs for their company without affecting other PMs' relationships with the provider.

The purpose of blacklisting a service provider is to prevent them from being assigned to jobs for a specific Property Manager company, while still allowing other PM companies to work with them.

To blacklist a service provider at the company level, go to the Service Providers page by clicking on **People** and then **Service Providers** in your dashboard.

When a service provider is blacklisted, they will be removed from all lists and categories within your property management company's account. Additionally, they will not be searchable within the account.

Once a Service Provider is blacklisted, you can find them in the **Blacklisted Service Provider Management** tab. If you wish to undo the blacklist, simply click on the strike and select **Undo Blacklist Service Provider**.

Keep in mind that if a blacklisted vendor already has an existing work order, they will still be assigned to the job unless you remove them manually.

It's important to note that blacklisting a vendor is different from deprioritizing them. While a deprioritized vendor remains on the list, they are not considered a priority for a certain category or skill, but can still be manually assigned.
