<Tip>
  **Pro Tip:** If you are not using an integration, we recommend exporting the work order history and uploading the PDF file to the corresponding work order in your Property Management system. This will help you keep a log of everything we did in Latchel in your management system!
</Tip>

Open the work order then go to the **Activity** tab. Under **All Activity**, a **download icon** can be clicked to download the all details of the work order.

A pop-up window should appear, prompting you to specify the location where you’d like to save the file. If you’d like, you can rename the file at this point. If not, skip this step. Click **Save** or **OK** to save the PDF file to your computer.
