#### **Guarantee and Warranty Policies**

1.  **Workmanship Guarantee**
    * Latchel Vendor Network service providers must offer a minimum 30-day workmanship guarantee. If the same issue recurs within this period, the service provider will address it at no additional cost. There may be additional charges if a new problem or different root cause is identified.
2.  **Warranty**
    * Latchel Vendor Network service providers also offer a 1-year warranty on parts.
3.  **Exceptions to Guarantee Warranty**
    * The guarantees **DO NOT** apply if:
        * The failure is due to equipment reaching its end of life and the replacement is denied.
        * An identified deeper root cause still needs to be addressed despite recommendations.
        * A different service provider completing work on the same issue voids both the workmanship guarantee and parts warranty from the initial Latchel Vendor Network service provider. This applies even if the second service provider was also sourced through Latchel. In such cases, no refunds for the initial repair will be issued.
