1.  Follow the steps in [](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Install-the-Latchel-Data-Sync-Extension) **[this customer guide](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Install-the-Latchel-Data-Sync-Extension)** to download the **Latchel Data Sync Chrome extension** and log in.

* Once signed into the extension successfully, you will see text on the extension drop-down that states, "**Logged in as PM Company Name**".

2.  Create a fake work order in your Property Management Software (PMS) and assign this fake work order to the Team Latchel user.

* Please be sure to assign Team Latchel as a user, not a service provider.


3.  Sign out of the Latchel Data Sync extension, and then sign back in.
4.  Sign out of your property management software and then sign back in.
5.  Navigate back to your property management software dashboard where you should see a floating Latchel logo at the top right. Click on the **logo** and select **Sync All Data**.

6.  It's also a best practice to automate the sync using one of the following options:

* **Hourly Sync:** When hourly sync is toggled on, the sync will initiate randomly at some point within the first 20 minutes of every hour.
* **Daily Sync:** When daily sync is toggled on, the sync will initiate randomly within the first 20 minutes of the specified hour of the user's time zone.

7.  Once the sync has been initialized, you can **complete** or **close** the test work order in your property management software (PMS).
