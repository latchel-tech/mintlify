description: "The property on a Work Order is used to reflect what address Latchel is coordinating the request on. "
mode: "wide"

<Info>
  **NOTE:** _Latchel can only have 1 address per Work Order, so if multiple units are affected, multiple requests must be opened for coordination unless resolving the issue in 1 unit solves it for the rest._
</Info>

To select the desired work order, from the dashboard, click on **the Maintenance tab**, and open the work order by either **searching and/or clicking the specific order number**. You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters** option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the Filter, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page.**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page)
