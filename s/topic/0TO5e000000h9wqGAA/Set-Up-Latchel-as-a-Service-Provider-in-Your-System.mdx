title: Set Up Latchel as a Service Provider in Your System
description: "If you are not utilizing a system integration, you can manually send Latchel work orders via your Property Management software system by setting Latchel up as a service provider."

Chances are, within your system, you already have a process as a Property Manager to assign work orders to a service provider. You’ll want to create Latchel as a service provider and follow this same process, however, instead of assigning a real service provider, you’ll assign Latchel as the service provider on the work order.

This is the best practice for ensuring Latchel has all the information required to successfully process your work order and that your work order is actionable. To be considered actionable, a work order must clearly contain the following:

**1\. The address where work is to be performed**


* The address should be complete and searchable using Google Maps or comparable mapping software. If the address is not searchable (e.g. private roads not yet mapped in public databases), we request you include navigation instructions in the work order description.


**2**. **Tenant name and contact information clearly displayed**


* Include the tenant's phone number at a minimum and their resident’s email, if available.
* If the unit is vacant, you must include access instructions for the service provider.


**3\. A clear description of the work to be performed**

* Most systems automatically include the unedited tenant request, so we rely on either service provider instructions or guidance in the work order description.


Now to set Latchel as a service provider, log in to your Property Management software system and create Latchel as a service provider using the email **[workorders@latchel.com](mailto:workorders@latchel.com)**, and username Team Latchel.

We will receive these requests via email. Our inboxes are checked 24/7, however, it could take up to 3 hours for our team to create the work order in Latchel. If you need to send our team an **emergency**, please create the work order directly in your portal, call your emergency line, or have your resident call in.

_This is the process that is best suited for receiving actionable work orders by email. We will not receive all the information if we are set up as Property Managers in your system._


Follow your standard process and assign Team Latchel as the **service provider** on your work order.

_Some systems don’t have automation in place to trigger an email after service provider assignment, if applicable, make sure you **SUBMIT** the work order to Team Latchel to trigger an email (some software systems will skip this step)._
