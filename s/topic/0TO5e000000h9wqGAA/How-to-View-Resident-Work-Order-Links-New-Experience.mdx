You can also use the **Filter** and **Clear Filters** option for a more refined search. To learn more about how to use the Filter, check out this help guide: [**How to Use the Filter Options in the Work Order Tab Page**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Use-the-Filter-Options-in-the-Work-Order-Tab-Page) .

From a work order page, go to **Details**. Scroll down until you see the **Additional Information** section on the right-hand side of the page. From here, **copy** the **Resident Work Order Link** and navigate to wherever you wish to open the link. You may also provide the link to the resident so they can view the work order.
