Here's how it works:

Visit your Latchel dashboard and click on the **Portfolio** drop-down. From here, you can click **Select All** if you want to see all the properties associated with any of your portfolios or select any specific portfolio by choosing the box corresponding to it.

As a result, only properties within the selected portfolio that require any actions will show under the Action Required section.
