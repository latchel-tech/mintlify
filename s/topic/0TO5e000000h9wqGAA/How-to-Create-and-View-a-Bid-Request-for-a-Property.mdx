Notice that there are three work orders for this bid. The work orders are one for each service provider that was chosen so that they have specific work orders they are assigned to and know what the next step would be. 

The current state of the work order is **Scheduling with the Service Provider** so they can visit the property and assess the condition of the work order. The state will change depending on the progress made by the Service Provider to complete the job.
