**To update the number of a work order follow these steps:**

From the Dashboard, click on **Maintenance**, and open the work order by either **searching and/or clicking the specific order number**. You can also use the **Filter** option for a more refined search.

  **NOTE:** **_When a Property Manager or Latchel admin chooses the filter option, the previous filters will automatically save in any place of the work order page even if the user logs out and logs back in, to clear or reset this, click on Clear Filters._**

Now that you are on the work order page, click the work order number, and change or update the work order number as desired. Then click the **green check** iconÂ to save the changes.
