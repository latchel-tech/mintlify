title: "Setting Up Pre-Dispatch Instructions with Latchel"
description: "As a Property Manager, you can provide instructions for the Latchel team to follow before dispatching a service provider occurs."
mode: "wide"
---

<Info>
  **NOTE**: _These instructions are ONLY for Emergency work orders._
</Info>

#### **Successful Use Of Pre-Dispatch Instructions:**

- Provide the list of contacts to reach out to before dispatching a service provider.
- Provide special instructions to prevent dispatching for certain types of issues.
- Provide helpful contextual advice for the team because of unique property conditions.

#### **Appropriate Use Cases:**

- Pre-Dispatch Escalation - Includes a list of contacts to be reached out to before dispatching a service provider.

<Info>
  **NOTE:** _PM escalations before dispatching can be attempted via all contact methods. This doesn't imply waiting for responses; moving forward is permissible if escalation contacts are unresponsive._
</Info>

#### **Prohibited Uses of Pre-Dispatch Instructions:**

- Instructing specific service providers to be dispatched. Instead, these should be configured in the priority list for dispatching.
