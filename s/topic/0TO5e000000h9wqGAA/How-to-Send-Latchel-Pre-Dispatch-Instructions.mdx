title: "Setting Up Pre-Dispatch Instructions with Latchel"
description: "As a Property Manager, you can provide instructions for the Latchel team to follow before dispatching a service provider occurs."
---


<Warning>
  These instructions are ONLY for Emergency work orders.
</Warning>

### **Benefits of Pre-Dispatch Instructions**

- Provide the list of contacts to reach out to before dispatching a service provider.
- Provide special instructions to prevent dispatching for certain types of issues.
- Provide helpful contextual advice for the team because of unique property conditions.

### **The Pre-Dispatch Contact Details**

This must includes a list of contacts to be reached out to before dispatching a service provider.

<Info>
  PM escalations before dispatching can be attempted via all contact methods. This doesn't imply waiting for responses; moving forward is permissible if escalation contacts are unresponsive.
</Info>

### **What _Not_ to Include in Pre-Dispatch Instructions**

Pre-dispatch instructions should focus on critical steps Latchel needs to follow before sending a vendor. Avoid adding general property notes, vendor preferences, or post-dispatch follow-ups to keep your instructions clear, actionable, and effectiveâ€”because these notes can be configured in other settings of your account.

The table below shows what is not to be included in pre-dispatch notes.
