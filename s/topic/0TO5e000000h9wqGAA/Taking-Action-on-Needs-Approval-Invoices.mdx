title: Taking Action on Needs Approval Invoices
description: "This help guide will provide general information on different actions you can take as a property manager once an invoice is in **Needs Approval** status. Let's check out."

Search for the pending invoice. To do this, follow this help guide: **[Methods of Searching Invoices](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-View-and-Search-for-Invoices)**

Typically, an invoice gets paid automatically **three days after the invoice date** _unless there's a manual intervention from the property managers_ or _if it remains in the Needs Approval state_ **due to a predefined Invoice Auto-approval Threshold** which in this case, the invoice will automatically set to pending. Nevertheless, there are several actions that you can initiate. Let's dive into those.

#### **Dispute Invoice**

As a property manager, you may dispute the invoice if you have questions on **how the work order job was completed**, the **amount of the invoice**, the **technician who took the job**, **etc**.

Once on the invoice page, click the **Dispute Invoice**. The invoice activity will show that the Invoice status was changed to **"Dispute"**. If an invoice is under dispute, Latchel will reach out to you or to the assigned property manager in the work order to get more information and make an attempt to resolve the case.Â

#### **Cancel Invoice**

If an invoice becomes **unnecessary** or was **generated in error**, this can be canceled. Once canceled, the status of the invoice will promptly change to Canceled. _**I**_**_t's important to keep the service provider informed about the circumstances leading to the invoice cancellation._**A detailed explanation or information as to why the invoice is canceled is a **must**.

Payment can be **set earlier or beyond the standard three-day threshold**. To action this, click on **Schedule Payment**, select the **preferred date for rescheduling**, and hit **Save**.

This action will take the invoice status to "**Pending (Unpaid)"**, and a notification will materialize indicating the anticipated payment date. Additionally, **an email will be sent to the service provider**, informing them of when they can expect the payment to be reflected in their bank account.

#### **Pay Now**

As a property manager you have the discretion to process payment immediately upon completion of the job or as soon as the service provider forwards the invoice. This decision lies entirely in the hands of the Property Manager.

<Info>

**NOTE:** _Actions made on the invoice do not affect the status of the work order. More so, setting up a specific amount in the **Invoice Auto-Approval Threshold** does not alter the typical workflow of a work order._
