### **Resident Review URL for Global Settings**

Resident Review URL can be customized within your main company Account Settings which will be inherited by all properties. Here's how you can customize it within your Account Settings.

From your dashboard, click your **Account icon** at the upper right hand corner of the page. Then select **Account Settings**.

### **Portfolio Resident Review URL**

If your properties are grouped into different portfolios, you can customize the Resident Review URL for each portfolio.

In your dashboard, click **Places** then choose **Portfolios**.

Once done, you'll notice that the settings indicate **"Overrides Company,"** along with options to **Edit** or **Remove**. If you wish to update or delete the custom URL, you can use either of these options.

Use **Edit** to update the Resident Review URL, and **Remove** if you'd like the portfolio to inherit the Resident Review URL from the global account settings.

<Tip>
  Only residents who are assigned to and active on properties within the portfolio can access the customized Resident Review URL for that portfolio.

And that's how easy you can customize your Resident Review URL\!
