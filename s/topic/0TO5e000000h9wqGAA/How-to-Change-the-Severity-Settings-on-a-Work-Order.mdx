<Info>
  **NOTE:** _When an Emergency is chosen, a few questions must be accomplished._
</Info>

The first question is, **Are you able to set a work date for this WO now?** If **Yes** is chosen, it will prompt to supply the service provider to schedule an appointment.

The next question will ask you to select an appointment window for the service provider visit. It is also advisable to include a summary explaining the reason for this action. Finally, click on the **Submit** button.

The only difference when **No** is chosen is that the work order will immediately go to emergency status. This action will not trigger any troubleshooting intervention from our Operations Support Team, so it is advisable to choose this only if it is for tracking purposes.
