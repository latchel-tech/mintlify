When updating the severity settings on a work order, you can choose to apply the changes to the current active work order or set them at the company or property level, which will affect future work orders.

### **Changing Severity Settings on a Single Work Order**

From the work order page that requires severity settings change, click on the **drop-down** button. The severity setting is right above the work order title.

You can find a confirmation of the change on the **ACTIVITY** page under the **All Activity** tab. This will display the date of the change and the person who made the change.

<Info>
  **When an Emergency is chosen, a few questions must be accomplished.**
</Info>

The first question is, **Are you able to set a work date for this WO now?** If **Yes** is chosen, it will prompt to supply the service provider to schedule an appointment.

The next question will ask you to select an appointment window for the service provider visit. It is also advisable to include a summary explaining the reason for this action. Finally, click on the **Submit** button.

The only difference when **No** is chosen is that the work order will immediately go to emergency status. This action will not trigger any troubleshooting intervention from our Operations Support Team, so it is advisable to choose this only if it is for tracking purposes.

### **Applying Severity Setting to Future Work Orders**

In an active work order, navigate to the Problem and Location section and click the "**here**" hyperlink.

<Tip>
  **If the severity setting was previously applied to the work order, the "here" hyperlink may not be available. Instead, click <u>View Severity/Responsibility Settings.</u>**
