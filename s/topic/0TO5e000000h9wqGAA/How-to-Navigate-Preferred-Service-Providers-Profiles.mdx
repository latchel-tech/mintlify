#### **Finding a Service Provider profile within the Latchel Portal**

</Frame>

The list of service providerswill be narrowed down as you type the name. Once you find the service provider's name you are searching for, click on the** Service Provider **to open the service provider's profile page. **_If you do not see the service provider you are looking for, check_** [**_How to Add & Manage Service Providers_**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Add-Manage-Service-Providers).

#### **Service Provider Profile (Details Tab)**

When you open the service provider's profile page, you will find multiple sections of information on the **Details** tab.

#### **Work Order Settings**

Here you will see invoice collection and service provider lock-in settings.

**Invoice Collection:** You may disable the workflow in Latchel’s software to collect invoices from preferred service providers. This is the best thing to do if your preferred network does not invoice for work (i.e. supers or onsite techs), or if your preferred network will only be sending invoices to you directly.

**Service Provider Lock-In:** By default, we move on to a different service provider if the initial one fails to respond to our scheduling requests. However, some property managers may prefer to stick with a specific service provider, known as **Service Provider Lock-In**. We only implement **Service Provider Lock-In** after receiving an approved quote from the service provider. Otherwise, we respect the property manager’s preferences.

#### **Skills**

This section will list all of the skills the service provider has. **Skills** refer to the abilities or services a service provider offers their customers. Skills are specific to what needs to be done to resolve the maintenance request and will be grouped into Skill Categories. For example, for **Plumbing** (this is the Skill Category) related issues, the service provider below has multiple skills such as **Clear drain**,**Repair internal leaking**, **Repair external leaking**, and more.

You can add skills categories and skills to your preferred service provider. Once you assign the categories and skills to your preferred service providers, you can remove or add skills already assigned in the service provider profile on the prioritization page.

#### **Notes and Activity**

This is to be used if the Latchel Team has notes to add to the service provider profile and those notes can or not be visible to the service provider. Currently, nothing is being auto-populated there.
