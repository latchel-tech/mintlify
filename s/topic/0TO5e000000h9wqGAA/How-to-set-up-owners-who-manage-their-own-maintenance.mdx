</Frame>
On the following page, add the necessary skills or skill set based on the range of work orders the owner intends to manage.


If the owner handles only specific types of work orders, select **\+ Add skills**, and a category bar will appear for you to search and choose the relevant skills.

If the owner willÂ manage all services and work orders for their properties, select **\+ Add "Quick Create"** **skill set**, and choose **All Skills and All Trades**.

</Frame>
After selecting the skill set, choose whether to prioritize them or not. Since this is for a specific portfolio, select "**I will prioritize later**" and then click **Save**.

Now, return to the Portfolio page and choose the portfolio specific to the owner that you recently created. From there, prioritize the owner as the service provider so that they are the sole contact for work orders.

Select the **Service Provider tab.** On the right side of the page, click the **three dots** option and select **Prioritize Service Provider for multiple skills.**


<Frame>

</Frame>

Search for the owner's name (service provider) and select the specific skill, or choose all of the skills if the owner wishes to be contacted for all work orders.


<Frame>

Next, select whether to prioritize them at the top or bottom of the skill categories, then click **Prioritize**.

To ensure that only the owner is contacted, disable inheritance from the company and avoid contacting any vendors if the owner does not respond.
