A note at the bottom of the page will indicate that the report is downloading. When prompted, save the file to your computer.

<Note>
  Exporting reports from a key metric tile will only download data based on that metric’s description.

### **Direct Download**

Once you access Analytics, you’ll see **2 download options** at the bottom-left corner of the screen.
