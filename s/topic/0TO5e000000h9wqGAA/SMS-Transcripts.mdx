<Info>
  **NOTE:** _SMS conversations must be tagged to the correct work order. We also recognize that residents, service providers, and owners might have multiple contact numbers. For ease of reference, these numbers are conveniently located right below the individual's name. The contact numbers of the recipient can be seen both in the SMS header and the left tab._
