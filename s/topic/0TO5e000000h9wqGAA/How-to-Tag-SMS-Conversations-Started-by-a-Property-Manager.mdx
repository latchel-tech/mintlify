title: How to Tag SMS Conversations Started by a Property Manager
---

Property Managers have two options when starting a new SMS Conversation within the Latchel console: 1) Clicking an SMS icon within a work order page and 2) Clicking an SMS icon within a "general" page. For the purpose of this guide, we are defining a "general" page as one that does not pertain to a specific work order.

**Option 1: Starting an SMS Conversation from a Work Order Page**
When a Property Manger starts an SMS conversation from a work order page, the conversation will always automatically be tagged to that work order. It's important to note that the conversation will not be tagged until the conversation is started by the Property Manager (when the Property Manager sends an SMS to the person). If they decide to change their mind on the tag, they always have the option to edit it.

**Option 2: Starting an SMS Conversation from a "General" Page**
Examples of "General" pages are user lists (see below) or user profile pages.

When a Property Manager chooses to start an SMS conversation from a "general" page, they will now be shown this modal. It asks them what work order that they want to talk about with that person. They may choose the work order by **selecting from the list of most recent work orders related to that person** or by **searching for a specific work order** through the search field.

Once a work order is selected, the SMS chat window will pop up. However, please note that the work order tag will not happen until a conversation is actually started with that person. If the Property Manager would just like to view the history, they do not have to start a conversation with that person.

Once a conversation is started, the Prpoperty Manager will then see the work order they chose in the modal show up in the header. This indicates that the newly started conversation has been tagged to the chosen work order.

Additionally, if the Property Manager wants to start a chat with someone without tagging it to a work order, they can choose the **Not related to a recent Work Order** option. The intention of including this is to account for situations where Property Managers may want to ask about general account questions that may not tie to a specific work order.
