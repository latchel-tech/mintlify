title: "Disable Online Maintenance Requests"
description: "You can disable the option for residents to submit maintenance requests directly in your property management system so that all requests are routed through Latchel."
---

To do this, create a property group that includes all your properties, then turn off online maintenance requests for that group. This ensures a centralized workflow and lets Latchel handle all maintenance efficiently.

### **Create Property Group**

1. Go to the **dashboard** and in the **Tasks Menu** on the right-hand side, find **Account** section near the bottom and click **Property Groups**.
2. In the Tasks menu on the right click **New Property Group**.
3. Enter a **Property Group Name**, then select all of the **Properties** you want in the group.

<Warning>
  Do not use any special characters in the name of the group. Only use letters and numbers.
</Warning>

4. Click **"Click here to search"** to filter all properties by the following categories:
   - **Property Name** - Search by a property name to pull matching results.
   - **Address or Zip** - Search by property address or zip code to find all matching results.
   - **Property Group** - Search by all properties within another, existing property group to find all matching results.
   - **Portfolio** - Search by all properties within a portfolio to find all matching results.
   - **Owner** - Search by properties owned by a specific owner to find all matching results.
   - **State** - Search by properties within a specific state to find all matching results.
   - **Selection** - Select this option to limit the view to "Show only selected properties" and/or "Show hidden properties" within the new property group.
5. Once you've selected all of your properties click **Save**.
