title: How to Add a Service Provider to a Property that is Outside of an Assigned Territory / Zip Code
---

Managing a service provider based on service territories can be actioned from the company, portfolio, or even property level. 

It is encouraged to assign service provider territory/zip code(s) when you do not want a service provider outside the property's territory/zip code to be contacted when a work order comes in. Otherwise, a service provider can be dispatched to all jobs regardless of their location based on service provider prioritization and configuration. 

However on this help guide, if you have a property that is not in a service provider's assigned territory/zip code but wishes to be assigned on a work order moving forward, you can follow this help guide to add them to your service provider's territory on a property level only. This action will not affect the company and portfolio level setup.

From your dashboard, click on **Places** then **Properties**.

From the Property Page, you can **Search** the property or **Select** it from the list.

Once you are on the property page, click on the **Service Providers** tab.

You may now choose the service provider you'd like to add to the property by clicking **\+ Include** beside its name.

And since the property is outside the service provider's territory, click **Continue **to allow the changes.

Then a new pop-up box will appear that will allow you to filter specific skills of the service provider. 

To finish the configuration, click on **Save**.
