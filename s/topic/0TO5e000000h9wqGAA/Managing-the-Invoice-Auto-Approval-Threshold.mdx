#### **The Invoice Auto-Approval Threshold**

**Invoice Auto-Approval Threshold** is a feature in Latchel that streamlines the invoice approval process for property managers. It allows property managers to set a threshold amount, and any invoices below this threshold are automatically approved, saving time and effort. With this feature, property managers can ensure timely payment for smaller invoices while maintaining control over larger expenditures.

#### **How to Set up the Invoice Auto-Approval Threshold**

On the Latchel portal, click the **account icon** dropdown and select **Account Settings.**

In this example, the value of this setting is $0, indicating that any invoices higher than $0 will require the property manager's approval. **By default, this setting is empty.** To add an amount, simply click on the **empty space**. If it already has a value, as shown in the example below, just click on the **number**, and it will become active for updating.

  **NOTE:** _As a_ _Property Manager, you can also manually approve the invoice to move forward, but if you need further help, contact Latchel at **[success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com). **__The implementation of invoice auto-approval does not influence the status or processing of Work Orders._
