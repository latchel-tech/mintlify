### **How to save a severity and responsibility preset?**


Saving a severity responsibility preset is an ideal approach when you want to make changes but are unsure about reverting to a previous setting. Additionally, presets can be set to accommodate different security settings based on weather conditions, seasons, daylight variations, and expected emergency situations. This allows for flexibility and efficient management of severity and responsibility settings.
