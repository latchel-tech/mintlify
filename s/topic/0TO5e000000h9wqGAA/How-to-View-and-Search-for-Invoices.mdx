#### **Searching Invoices Using the Filter**

On the invoice page, invoices can now be easily searched using the filter options. **Filter options** available are **by Status**:

- **Unpaid:** The invoice has been issued but has not yet been paid.
- **In Dispute:** There's an active issue or disagreement regarding the invoice that needs resolution.
- **Paid:** The invoice has been fully paid.
- **Cancelled:** The invoice was voided and is no longer valid for payment.
- **Partial Paid:** A portion of the invoice has been paid, but a balance remains.
- **Refunded:** The payment made on the invoice was returned to the payer.
- **Needs Approval:** The invoice is awaiting approval from the necessary party before it can move forward.
- **Pending:** The invoice is in a waiting stateâ€”typically awaiting action like review, approval, or payment.
- **Processing:** The invoice is actively being handled, such as being reviewed, approved, or queued for payment.
- **Submitted:** The invoice has been officially submitted into the system and is waiting for the next step in the workflow (e.g., approval or payment).
- **Failed Customer:** This means that there was a problem charging the customer, usually an issue with the payment method.
- \*\*Failed Vendor: \*\*means there was an issue paying out the vendor.

From the invoice page, click on the **Filter icon**, **check or uncheck**the desired filter box, and click on **Apply.**
