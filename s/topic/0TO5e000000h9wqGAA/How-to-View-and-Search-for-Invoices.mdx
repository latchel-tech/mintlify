Search for the work order. To do this you may follow the steps in **[Quick Search Box for Work Orders](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/Quick-Search-Box-for-Work-Orders)**. Then, from the left side of the work order page, click **Invoices**.

#### **Searching Invoices Using the Filter**

On the invoice page, invoices can now be easily searched using the filter options. **Filter options** available are **by Status**:

* Unpaid
* In dispute
* Paid
* Cancelled
* Partial Paid
* Refunded


From the invoice page, click on the **Filter icon**, **check or uncheck**the desired filter box, and click on **Apply.**

In the Invoice Details page, click **View Uploaded Invoice File** or **View the file**, then a new window tab will open containing the invoice preview.
