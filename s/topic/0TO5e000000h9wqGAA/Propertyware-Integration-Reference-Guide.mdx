To learn more about activating the Propertyware integration with Latchel, please visit this link: [How to Activate the Client Propertyware Integration](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Activate-the-Client-Propertyware-Integration)**.**

#### **This Integration Accomplishes the Following**

1. **Properties:** Property fields are automatically brought over from Propertyware to Latchel via initial sync with a two-hour interval.

2. **Residents:** For both initial and regular sync, only residents with active leases are included on the imports for initial and ongoing sync. Much like properties, resident details are also synced with a two-hour interval

3. **Work Orders:** Work orders are excluded from all syncs if the owner's email does not match the email used to access Propertyware (as supplied when setting up the integration).

**Each work order is:**

* Assigned to a property manager based on the property manager user ID related to the property

* Linked to an existing property & unit in Latchel 

* If a resident's information is supplied, the work order will also be assigned to an existing resident in Latchel.

* Photos, Calls, SMS Logs, and Invoices are automatically uploaded when the work order is complete.

1. **Owners, and Service Providers:** These are not automatically synced but an option to upload a (.)csv file is available.

#### **Two Directions of Data Desynchronization After the Initial Sync**

#### Subsequent syncs will look for any data that was created or updated **within the last 72 hours**. The syncs run every hour, starting sometime in the first 5 minutes of the hour, and may take between 15-45 minutes to complete. 

**A. Propertyware ----> Latchel**

**I. Newly Created Data**

1. **Properties and Residents -** New properties, and residents will sync all information to Latchel the same rule as the initial sync.

2. **Work Order** - In order for new work orders to sync to Latchel, the “**Managed By**” field must be assigned to the Latchel user in Propertyware. There is no way to automatically have all of the “Managed By” fields filled out when a maintenance request is submitted. It has to be manually done by someone on the team. Normally:

   * When a **resident submits the WO**, the Managed By field will be **blank**.

   * When a **Propertyware user creates the WO**, the Managed By **defaults to the user that created the WO**.

**To customize the "Managed By" field:**

* Go to your Settings.

* Go to Customize Maintenance/Maintenance Settings.

* There should be a “Managed By” option where you can pick the default user (which could be the Latchel user).

1. **Leases -** The lease sync runs at **11:30 pm UTC every night** and is thus synchronized from Propertyware to Latchel once a day.

**II. Existing or Previously Created Data**

1. **Property -** synchronization of existing or previously created property will only update the integration data field.

**Automatic Property Reconciliation**

To ensure accurate customer billing Latchel runs on automated process each month to de-activate any active units in Latchel that no longer exist in the Propertyware property list integrated with Latchel. This process currently happens on the **27th at 3am PST**.

Customers can view information about recently de-activated units on the Reports page. They can also export a list of the units deleted in the most recent snapshot.&#x20;

When a property is deactivated through this process. It will be logged to the property in Latchel.

<Info>
  **NOTE:** *Properties that were manually disabled in Latchel, whether requested or not, will not automatically reactivate, even if the status of the property in Propertyware is still active.*
</Info>

1. **Residents -** The integration will not currently update contact information, name nor “**active**” status.Once a resident is created a two things will change on the subsequent sync:

   * The property and unit the resident is associated with

   * The move\_in and move\_out dates. Any issues with move in/out dates needs to be resolved in Propertyware when an integration is in place. These fields can be found on the tenant's lease.

1. **Work Orders (WO) -** The integration will not update any fields on previously created or existing work orders.

2. **Leases -** We update all values if it is an existing lease. So whatever new values come in from the sync would override the old ones.

**B. Latchel ----> Propertyware**

1. **Properties and Residents -** Manually created properties and residents in Latchel will not sync to Propertyware. Hence, the option to create new properties and residents in the Latchel console is unavailable.

2. **Work Orders -** If a work order (job) is created in the Latchel console it will automatically trigger a sync to also create it in Propertyware (PW). Updating that work order (job) in Latchel will automatically sync over the changes from Latchel to PW.

**Work Order Sync Status**

When a customer is on an *active* integration, an indication will show at the top of each work order whether or not the WO was successfully sync’d with the customer’s PMS. Example below.

#### **Manually Sync WO**

Customers can manually trigger a **Latchel ----> Platform** sync by going to the **Action** menu and clicking **Sync Now**. This will manually push the WO to the customer’s platform.
