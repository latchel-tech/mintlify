title: Enabling Latchel Vendor Network Via Work Order
description: "The **Latchel Vendor Network** is composed of extensive service provider companies from across the nation, many of which have only recently joined forces with Latchel to handle work orders for residents and property managers/owners."
mode: wide

The advantage of involving such large-scale companies is their abundant dispatch teams, which help ensure that work orders are assigned and accomplished promptly.

Latchel's goal is to streamline this service as much as possible and to assist property managers/owners in locating a suitable service provider, particularly when none of their preferred providers are available to accept the job. Let's begin by enabling the **Service Provider Auto-Assign Queue**.

From the work order page with the status of **Finding Service Provider**, click the pop-up message, **Help Me Find a Service Provider.**

In the new pop-up box, simply toggle the switch to **"on" **to enable auto-assign, then click **Confirm Choices** This will empower Latchel to get in touch with your preferred service providers directly.

In such event that the auto-assignment queue has **exhausted** the list of your service providers, Latchel has you covered! You can enable _**Auto-Assignment for the Latchel Vendor Network (LVN)**_. This increases your chances of finding a service provider to fulfill your work order.

From the Service Provider section of the work order, click on **View Auto-Assign Queue History**.

So, with Latchel Vendor Network Auto-Assignment now _**activated**_, what's the real payoff for Property Managers? Let's delve into the benefits.

1. **Auto Queue Visibility:**This feature aims to increase confidence in the auto-assign feature by showing the current and history of the auto-assignment.

2\. **Increased Availability:** Latchel promotes and believes in getting the work done faster if the work order is being offered to the Latchel Vendor Network too! Access to an extensive network of service providers ensures that property managers have a higher chance of finding a provider available to handle their work orders promptly, even when their preferred providers are unavailable.

3\. **Streamlined Service:** By leveraging the Latchel Vendor Network, property managers can streamline their service operations, simplify the process of finding a suitable service provider, and ensure efficient management of work orders across their properties.
