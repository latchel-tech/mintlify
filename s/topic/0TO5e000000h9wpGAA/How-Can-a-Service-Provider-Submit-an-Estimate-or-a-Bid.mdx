title: "Submitting an Estimate or Bid on a Work Order (Service Provider)"
description: "If the cost to complete a work order exceeds the approved budget limit for the property, service providers may submit their bid or estimate.

In either case, let's explore this step-by-step guide on how to submit a bid or estimate."

You can also attach an image or file by clicking on **Choose Image/File**. We highly recommend adding these, as most property managers request this information.

<Note>
  - If you encounter any difficulties while submitting the estimate through your service provider dashboard, you can send an email to [team@latchel.com](mailto:team@latchel.com).
  - Once the Property Manager approves the job and the resident completes the scheduling, the scheduling functions will be automatically sent to you if you're approved for the job.
