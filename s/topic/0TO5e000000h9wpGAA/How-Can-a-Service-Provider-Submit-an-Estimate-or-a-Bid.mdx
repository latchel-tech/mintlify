Alternatively, Property Managers can assign a work order to Service Providers, allowing them to submit their bids and enabling the Property Manager to choose the best bid.


In either case, let's explore this step-by-step guide on how to submit a bid or estimate.

From the Service Provider dashboard, click the **Work Order number** showing under the **Other Work Orders** status.

To submit an estimate, click on **Provide Work Order Update**.

The page will be routed to options available to update the job. Click on **Add Estimate**.

On this page, you will be asked to provide the estimated total cost for the work order. Type the amount under **New Total** and the reason for the budget increase under **Reason for/Description of new estimate**.

You can also attach an image or file by clicking on **Choose Image/File**. We highly recommend adding these, as most property managers request this information.

For detailed information on adding an image or a file, please check out this help guide: **[Adding Images/Files to a Work Order (Service Providers)](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wpGAA/How-to-Add-Images-Files-to-a-Work-Order)**


Now that the images and files have been uploaded, you can submit your bid for the Property Manager to review by clicking on **Send Estimate**.

Notice that the work order status is now **Needs Owner Approval**. To return to the main dashboard page, simply click on **OK**.

<Info>
**NOTE:**

* _If you encounter any difficulties while submitting the estimate through your service provider dashboard, you can send an email to **[team@latchel.com](mailto:team@latchel.com)**._
* _Once the Property Manager approves the job and the resident completes the scheduling, the scheduling functions will be automatically sent to you if you're approved for the job._
