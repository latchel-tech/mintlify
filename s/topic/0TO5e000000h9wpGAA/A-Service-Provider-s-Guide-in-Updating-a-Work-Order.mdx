### **Set a New Work Appointment**

As a service provider, you may set a new schedule based on the resident's availability. You may check this help guide for the step-by-step flow: [How to Accept and Schedule Work Orders (Service Providers)](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wpGAA/How-to-Accept-and-Schedule-Work-Orders)

### **Add Estimate**

If the job requires an additional budget to resolve the issue, you may send an estimate for Property Managers/Owners' approval. You may check this help guide for the step-by-step flow: [Submitting an Estimate or Bid on a Work Order (Service Provider)](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wpGAA/How-Can-a-Service-Provider-Submit-an-Estimate-or-a-Bid)

### **Mark Job as Complete**

Once the job is complete and to initiate an invoice for payment, click on **Mark Job as Complete**. By clicking it, you will have the following options:

- **Yes, it's done.** - if there is no additional work to do, and that job has been completed.
- **There's more to Do** - choose this option if the job is not yet finished and you need to make a follow-up visit to complete the job.

For this example, let's click **Yes, it's done**.

The next question will ask you if you have encountered damage that was caused by the Resident. **_Please make sure to appropriately answer if the damage was caused by the resident or not._**  Answering this question will allow the Property Manager or the Owner to properly bill the resident if necessary.

### **Follow-Up Work Required**

Next, click **Yes** or **No**, if a follow-up work is recommended or not. If you click No, the work order will proceed to **Confirming Completion** status.

On the other hand, choosing **Yes** will take you to the next page asking if you the following:

- Can you do the follow-up work?
- The project budget
- When can you do the job?

Click **Yes** if you believe a follow-up is required, and **No** if otherwise.

Clicking Yes will take you to the next page asking you **if you can do the follow-up work**, the option to **add the Project Budget**, and **when you can do the next work**. 

If you selected **Preferred Date**, you will be presented with a calendar to choose the date you can do the follow-up work.
