### **Accessing Your Latchel Dashboard Link Via Email**

A work order in Finding Service Provider will send automated invites to service providers on queue. The email will show from which Property Management company the work order is from and by clicking on **View Job Details**, it will route you to your **Latchel Dashboard** for you to update the work order.
