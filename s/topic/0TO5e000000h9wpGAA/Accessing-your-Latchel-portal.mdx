description: "Exciting news for Service Providers! With the Latchel portal, you can easily access and view all jobs, providing updates to keep things moving smoothly."

Whenever a work order becomes available depending on your skill set, **a notification will be sent** out through:

- **Automated emails from** [scheduler@latchel.com](mailto:scheduler@latchel.com)
- **Via SMS received from Latchel**

### **Accessing Your Latchel Dashboard Link Via Email**

A work order in Finding Service Provider will send automated invites to service providers on queue. The email will show from which Property Management company the work order is from and by clicking on **View Job Details**, it will route you to your **Latchel Dashboard** for you to update the work order.
