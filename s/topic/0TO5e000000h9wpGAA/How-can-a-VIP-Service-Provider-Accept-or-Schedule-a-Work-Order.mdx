If a new work order is on **Finding Service Provider** status and you are one of the service providers assigned, you will receive an email notification that a work order is available. To view or accept the job, click **View Job Details** on the email.

The Work Order Details become available as well as the **Accept and Schedule Job** option. To proceed, click **Accept and Schedule Job**.

<Info>
  **NOTE:**  _The complete property address will not show until you accept and schedule the job._

\*\*NOTE: \*\*_If there are multiple users within the service provider's profile, you will be prompted to choose the specific service provider user for whom you want to accept the work order after clicking Accept & Schedule Job._

On the next page, you will be asked to either accept the job **Now**, **Later**, or **Cancel**.

If you choose **Now**, you will be asked to choose a schedule based on the available time slots the resident has provided. If the resident has not provided available time slot, a calendar will show instead prompting you to choose for the date and arrival window for when you will be able to start the work order. After choosing the schedule, confirm the arrival window you've chosen, then click **Submit Schedule**. You may also click **Back** if you need to change the time slot.

Once the schedule is submitted, you will be notified at the top of the next page that the work order has been scheduled. Notice that the status of the work order will proceed to **Awaiting Work Date**.

**On the same page at the bottom, you'll notice that the work order site and the resident information are shared so you can contact them. What a great perks of a VIP Service Provider\!**

Meanwhile, if you do not wish to schedule the job right away, you may choose **Later**. This will bring you 2 more options on the next page aside from choosing from the list of the resident's preferred time slots. You may choose between:

- **I spoke to the Resident, we have agreed upon a different time**
- **None of these times work, I have not spoken to the Resident**

By, clicking **I spoke to the Resident, we have agreed upon a different time,** a calendar will appear and you may pick the schedule based on your agreement with the resident.

Once done, click **Submit Schedule** to confirm the selected date and arrival window. The job status will then proceed to **Awaiting Work Date** indicating that you have successfully scheduled the work order\! You may now sit back and relax, and wait until it's your scheduled day\!

On the other hand, clicking **None of these times work, I have not spoken to the Resident** will route the work order to notify the resident that a new availability is needed.

After clicking **Request Reschedule**, the resident will be requested for a new availability. Notice that the status of the work order will proceed to **Rescheduling Resident**.

However, if scheduling Now or Later does not suit you or you are not yet ready to book the appointment, you may exit the scheduling window by clicking on **My Work Orders.**

The page will be routed to the main dashboard. Notice that the work order has now been allocated to you and falls under **Scheduling** as the appointment schedule has not yet been established.

**So being a VIP service provider, you can accept the work order without completing the scheduling at the same time\! What a great feature\!**

Clicking the **work order under Scheduling** will take you back again to the steps in scheduling the work order\!

And that's it\! What a great adventure of accepting a work order as a VIP Service Provider\!
