### **Sign In to Latchel**

As a Service Provider, when you access your dashboard, you'll be taken to the public dashboard where you can see four columns showing the **Action Required**, **Awaiting Work Date**, **In Progress**, and **Done** status.

Once inside, you’ll have access to many more columns and detailed information about your work orders, including those waiting for approval. All of your work orders will be categorized based on the following provided columns: **Scheduling**, **Confirming Completion**, **Awaiting Invoice**, **Scheduled Today**, **Scheduled Later**, **Other Work Orders**, **Completed**, and **Cancelled**.

In addition, you'll also have access to your **Invoices**, **Account Settings**, and the option which will take you to the **Latchel Help Center**. Let's delve to each of these features!
