  Multiple files can be uploaded like the before and after images of the job. An estimateÂ or bid should not be submitted here otherwise, it will not be processed. Use the estimate submission form instead.

A notification will show that **"Your files** **have been uploaded"**. To go back to the main dashboard, click on **My Work Orders.**
