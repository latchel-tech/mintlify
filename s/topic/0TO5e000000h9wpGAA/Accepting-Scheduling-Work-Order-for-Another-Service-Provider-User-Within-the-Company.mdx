In your service provider dashboard, you will notice that you have **new jobs available** that need to be accepted and scheduled.

Clicking the **new jobs available** notification will direct you to the available job page where you can choose which work order you want to accept and schedule by clicking the **View Work Order** icon of the chosen work order.

After analyzing the details of the work order and deciding to accept it, just hit the **Accept & Schedule Job** icon on the upper right side of the page.

Now the primary service provider user can choose to which user the work order will be assigned. Either assigning the work order to her/himself or assigning it to another service provider user.

### **Primary Service Provider User**

If the primary service provider user would like to assign the work order to her/himself just click the green label that says **Myself** with the corresponding name.

Then on the next screen pick a schedule based on the resident's availability.

Now review if you have selected the correct arrival window, and hit **Submit Schedule**.

Then the work order will be assigned in the **primary service provider user** dashboard under **Scheduled Today** or **Scheduled Later**.

### **Other Service Provider User**

The primary service provider user can choose **other user** to handle the work order.

On the next screen, the primary service provider user needs to choose a schedule on behalf of the other service provider user based on the resident's availability.

Then review if the selected schedule is correct and hit **Submit Schedule**.

Since this work order is scheduled for the **other service provider user**, the work order will be assigned to the dashboard of that other user under **Scheduled Today** or **Scheduled Later** depending on the availability schedule.

And that is how a primary user can accept or schedule a work order for other service providers\!
