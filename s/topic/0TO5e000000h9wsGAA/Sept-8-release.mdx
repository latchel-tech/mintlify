### **New Features**

1. **Concise Work Order Summaries & Smarter Titles**

We’ve made it even easier to quickly understand what’s happening at intake.

Based on customer feedback, work order summaries are now presented in **just a couple of clear sentences**—so you no longer need to read through the full intake back-and-forth to get the key details.

Intake Settings users will also notice **more relevant work order titles** that better reflect the actual issue, making it simple to scan and prioritize at a glance.

- Property Managers will receive concise summaries directly in their notifications.
- Service Providers will continue to receive both the summary and the full resident Q&A for additional context.

This update reduces effort and saves time for your team while still ensuring the right people have the right level of detail.

### **Resolved Bug**

**Resident Benefits Access**

Between **8/25 and 9/2**, Resident Benefits links and embedded content were intermittently unavailable. During this time, residents were unable to proceed after entering their phone number because the **SUBMIT** button remained greyed out.

This issue has now been fully resolved, and functionality is back to normal\!

### **Key Process Changes**

**Customer Callback Numbers**

Our Ops team will now ensure the **correct callback number is provided based on who they’re contacting**. This change helps prevent misdirected inquiries, reduce customer frustration, and improve efficiency in handling requests.
