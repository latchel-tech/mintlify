### **New Features**

1. **Expanded Sync for Rent Manager & Propertyware**

We’re excited to announce a major improvement to our integrations with **Rent Manager** and **Propertyware!**

<Warning>
  **What's changing?**

  Previously, work orders and file updates only synced from Latchel when marked as "Cancelled", "Completed", or "Forwarded to PM".
</Warning>

  With this release, **_files now sync automatically on any state change_** — giving you faster, more accurate visibility into your work order activity.

Special thanks to **Metropolitan** for requesting this enhancement!

This upgrade means less manual follow-up, smoother coordination, and improved accuracy across your integration workflows.

2. **Full Control Over Service Providers**

We’ve just made it easier than ever for Property Managers to manage their service providers in Latchel.

Until now, there have been restrictions on when and how you could remove or change a service provider on a work order. With this release, **all restrictions have been removed** — giving you the flexibility to **add, remove, or update service providers at any time.**

This update puts full control back in your hands, making vendor management faster, simpler, and more efficient.

3. **Weather-Aware Resident Intake**

Resident intake is now **weather-aware** with the new **Intake Settings** .

Property Managers can set emergency rules that automatically factor in **real-time outdoor conditions**. Latchel now pulls **3 days of weather data** including current and daily min/max and “feels like” temperatures, UV index, humidity % and dew point, current and daily rain/snow forecasts, and more!

<Check>
  **What This Means:**

  - Accurate emergency categorization without resident input
  - Fewer intake questions for residents
  - Automatic application of your rules (e.g., HVAC = emergency if outside temperature above 80° or below 45°)
  - Weather data shown in intake details for PMs & Latchel troubleshooting
</Check>

**Example**

If your rule set includes that HVAC is an emergency when outside temperatures exceed 80°, and a resident reports their A/C is out, Latchel already knows that the **outdoor temperature is 92°** and therefore the work order is categorized as an **emergency** — without needing to ask the resident any questions about current weather conditions.

This weather-aware upgrade means intake is now faster, smarter, and perfectly aligned with your customized rules.

### **Resolved Bugs**

**Global Work Order Search Bar**

We’ve fixed an issue where the **global Work Order search bar would disappear intermittently** when typing.

Thanks to **E-Support** for reporting this bug! 

Now you can reliably search Work Orders without interruption.

### **Special Announcements**

1. **Free Rent Reporting**

We've made credit reporting even better for your residents! We’ve included rent reporting as a **free part of Latchel’s core benefits** service through our new partner Self. They will automatically report to **all three major credit bureaus** (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion) for residents who register. This works differently than our paid add-on partner Pinata. This free version requires residents to register for credit reporting and does not include rent rewards.

**If you are interested in switching to this free version, please reach out to your Customer Success Manager.** Additionally, residents have the option to upgrade for a small monthly fee to include credit reporting on their utility payments, providing them with even more opportunities to build their credit history. This valuable benefit helps your residents improve their financial health at no cost to you.

2. **Better Benefits Marketing**

Say goodbye to manually promoting resident benefits! Due to numerous requests from our community, our new recurring benefits marketing system does the heavy lifting for you. Your residents will now automatically receive regular communications about all available benefits and guidance on how to use them. This means better benefit utilization for your residents and less work for your team.

By default, residents will receive reminders about their benefits once per month. **If you’d like to disable these resident benefits reminders, please contact your Customer Success Manager.**

3. **Affordable HVAC Filter Delivery**

We're excited to announce our new HVAC filter delivery program at just ⅓ of our previous cost. At a low cost per unit per month, Latchel can now deliver high quality **Merv-8 filters** to your units on a quarterly cadence. We can also ship bimonthly at a slightly higher cost. For customers with just one filter per home, Latchel can customize pricing even lower!

Whether you're interested in starting a filter program for your residents or switching to the lower cost to take advantage of these significant savings, simply **reach out to your**  **Customer Success Manager to get started.**
