The following are the Latchel updates for the week of February 23, 2026.

### **New Features**

1. Introducing Analytics

We’re excited to announce a major upgrade to Latchel Reporting: **Analytics+** — powerful new insights designed to help you understand performance, spot trends faster, and make smarter portfolio decisions.

If you already use Latchel Analytics, this is the next level.

<Tip>
  **What's Included:**

  **Basic Analytics (Included with all subscriptions)**

  Every Latchel customer already has access to core reporting, including **reporting for the past 90 days**:

  - Work Order Performance
  - Vendor Performance
  - Latchel Performance
  - Property Insights
  - On-Call Scorecards
  - Share Reports Outside of Latchel
  - Scheduled Reports
</Tip>

These dashboards help you stay informed and monitor day-to-day operations with recent performance data.

**Analytics + New Capabilities**

**A. Performance Benchmarks**

Compare your portfolio performance against broader Latchel data to understand how you’re doing relative to other property managers.

**B. Custom Metrics, Graphs & Reporting**

Request and build dashboards tailored to your business:

- Track the KPIs that matter most to you
- Create custom visualizations
- Generate owner-ready reports faster

**C. Custom AI Insights**

Get intelligent, automated insights that help you:

- Identify trends early
- Spot inefficiencies
- Understand performance changes

**D. Unlimited Historical Data**

No more 90-day limit — access your **full reporting history** for long-term analysis and owner reporting.

**Pricing:** Analytics+ is available for as little as **\$0.25 per unit / month** _(with a \$100/month minimum)_.

We built Analytics+ based on your feedback. While existing reports help you monitor recent performance, many customers wanted more customization, benchmarking, and deeper historical data. Analytics+ delivers exactly that—giving you more powerful insights to support smarter, data-driven decisions.
