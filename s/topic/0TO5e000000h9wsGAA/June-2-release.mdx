### **New Features**

1. **Time-Saving Work Order Creation Options Just Launched\!**

- **Create from the Resident Profile Page** 

Need to submit a work order for a specific tenant? Now you can do it directly from the resident’s profile page\!\
The system automatically pulls in the resident and property info – so you skip the address search and get right to it.

- **“Create Another Work Order” with One Click**

After submitting a work order, you’ll now see a **“Create Another Work Order”** button. This puts you back into the creation flow with key info (like the selected property and vacancy status) pre-filled, so you can keep things moving without starting from scratch. This is especially useful when creating work orders as part of Inspections and Projects.

2. **Seamless File & Photo Previews on Work Orders**

Viewing attachments just got a major upgrade\! You can now **preview all files and images directly within a work order** — no more opening new browser tabs or downloading files just to take a quick look.

Simply click to open a **carousel-style preview** and scroll through everything in one place. Whether it’s resident uploads or vendor photos, you’ll save time and stay focused\!

3. **Latchel’s Automation Is Now Visualized on Every Work Order**

Wondering what’s happening behind the scenes after you submit a work order? Now you don’t have to guess.

We’ve launched a new **visual progress tracker** at the top of every work order page that shows exactly where a job stands in Latchel’s automation flow — from **intake to completion**.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Accurate “On Hold” Messaging for Jobs with Canceled Appointments**

**We resolved a bug that was causing some confusion:**

Previously, customers might see a message like **_“This job is on hold”_** or **_“The future appointment has been cancelled”_** — even when the appointment was earlier in the day or no future appointment existed.

<Check>
  **What’s Fixed:**\
  Now, these messages are only sent when a job had a future appointment scheduled that was later canceled or placed on hold. No more premature alerts or mixed signals.
