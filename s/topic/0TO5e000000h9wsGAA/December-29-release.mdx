### **New Features**

1. **New UI Improvements for Multiple Issues Detected**

We’ve made updates to improve how multiple issues from a single intake session are displayed—making it easier to understand what was created and how everything connects.

When more than one issue is detected, work orders are grouped under a single **Project**, with one clearly marked **Primary Issue** and any **Related Issues**.

<Check>
  **What's New:**

  - **Clear Primary vs. Related Issues** – The primary work order is now clearly identified (⭐), with related work orders labeled accordingly.
  - **Related Work Orders View** – The Primary Work Order now includes a Related Work Orders section, showing all issues created from the same intake session in one place.
  - **Cleaner Intake Details** – Full rule processing details live on the Primary Work Order, while related work orders keep the conversation visible without duplicate information.

<Note>
  **Why It Matters:**

  These improvements give you more clarity and control before dispatching—especially for secondary, non-emergency issues—so you can confirm the right action every time.

  We’ll continue refining this experience and welcome your feedback as we iterate further.
</Note>

2. **Consolidated Service Provider Notifications**

We used to send new texts and emails to your service providers on every single new work order and completed appointment. Now we batch messages that aren't urgent.

<Check>
  **What's New:**

  - Daily Summary at about 4pm reminding them what actions they need to take.
  - New job offers will still be sent in real time.
</Check>

<Note>
  **Why It Matters:**

  We've received complaints from you and your service providers that we send too many messages. Now we have reduced the messages so they can focus more on what matters: accepting, scheduling and completing work quickly without distractions.
</Note>

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Standardized Resident Greeting**

We’re updating our service operations guidelines to reinforce Latchel’s role as a collaborative extension of your maintenance team when communicating with Residents.

<Warning>
  **What’s Changing:**

  Our new and improved resident greeting identifies Latchel as a partner to your company:

  **“Hi, this is [Name] calling from Latchel, the maintenance intake team for [Property Management Company Name],** regarding your recent maintenance request.”
</Warning>

This update reduces resident confusion and positions Latchel as a reliable extension of your team. No action needed, as the change applies automatically across all resident communications.

2. **Standardized Communication Scripts & Templates**

Building on our recent communication updates, we’ve further refined our SOPs and job aids to standardize how we communicate with residents, service providers, and owners—ensuring messaging is clear, professional, and consistent across all touchpoints.

<Check>
  **What's Updated:**

  - **Revised Blurbs** – Standard resident greetings now reflect our updated positioning.
  - **Refined Scripts** – Clear guidance for when residents ask who we work with or request transfers to property managers or other teams.
  - **Updated Terminology** – References to “your Property Manager” have been replaced with “the appropriate team” to set clear expectations and avoid confusion.
</Check>

All SOPs and pre-written templates have been updated to reflect this language!
