### **New Features**

1. **Smarter, Smoother Custom Intake Experience**

We’re excited to share the latest evolution of **Latchel’s Custom Intake Settings**, designed to make troubleshooting cleaner and more efficient — improving both the **resident experience** and **work order accuracy**.

<Check>
  **What's New:**

  - **Better Troubleshooting Compliance:** Our system now follows Latchel’s proprietary troubleshooting directives more intelligently, ensuring every relevant step is completed — or smartly skipped when not needed.
  - **Smarter Suggested Answers:** Residents will now see more relevant, concise suggestions (capped at five per step), while still being able to type free-form answers.
  - **Fewer Repeat Questions:** We’ve reduced or eliminated duplicate questions in the intake flow to make the process smoother and more efficient.
  - **Seamless Session Recovery:** If a resident refreshes their browser mid-intake, they’ll automatically resume right where they left off — no need to start over.

  **Why It Matters:**\
  \
  These improvements help reduce troubleshooting friction and lower abandonment rates — leading to **quicker resolutions** and **happier residents.**
</Check>

**We Want Your Feedback**

Your feedback has directly shaped these enhancements. If you notice anything unexpected or have ideas for future improvements, we’d love to hear from you! If you don’t see “Intake Details” on your work orders, request a free upgrade by emailing [success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com).

2. **Global & Kanban Search: 96% Faster**

We’ve supercharged **Global and Kanban search** for PMs and Admins to make it faster and more efficient than ever.

**Performance Highlights**

- **96% Reduction in Wait Time:** Spend less time waiting on searches and more time taking action.
- **Smoother Workflows:** Whether you’re searching in Global or Kanban, results load almost instantly.

3. **Rentvine Integration: More Control Over Work Order Starting Status**

Property managers using Rentvine now have greater flexibility in how work orders sync from Latchel into their Rentvine system.

<Check>
  **Key Updates:**

  - You can now **choose the initial status** of a work order when it syncs from Latchel to Rentvine.
    - **Previously**, all synced work orders defaulted to “Closed,” which didn’t always match PMs’ workflows.
  - Available status options: **Open, Completed, Cancelled, Pending,** and **On Hold**.
</Check>

This gives PMs the power to align incoming work orders with their preferred process from the start.

**Bonus Improvement for All Integrations**

For PMs using **Rentvine**, **AppFolio**, **Propertyware**, **Rent Manager**, or **Yardi**, when a work order is marked as **Complete** or **Canceled** in Latchel, the corresponding status is **automatically updated** in the property management system — keeping both platforms aligned and saving PMs valuable time on manual updates.

For now, this setting can be configured **by the Latchel team**. If you’d like to update your starting status, just **reach out to us**, and we’ll get it set up for you. - email to [success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com) 

### **Resolved Bug**

**Unable to Leave Notes on Invoices**

We’ve resolved a bug that caused the screen to **jump around** while showing **_“no activity to display”_** and **three blue loading dots** at the bottom of the page. This happened when the activity feed failed to load properly. The display now remains stable, and the feed loads as expected.

### **Key Process Changes**

**Properly Diagnosing Emergency Situations**

We’ve updated our internal troubleshooting process to ensure photos are reviewed for emergency work orders during every severity assessment.

<Check>
  **What's Changing:**

  - Troubleshooters will **actively review available photos** (not just request them) when determining severity.
  - **All visual evidence** — from the initial order or any follow-ups — will be reviewed as part of evaluating or reassessing the work order.
  - If the **resident can’t be reached**, troubleshooters will compare the written description with available photos and **manually update severity** as needed.

  **Why This Matters:**\
  \
  This standardization improves diagnostic accuracy, reduces misclassification risk, and ensures emergencies are prioritized correctly.
