### **New Features**

1. **Update Work Order Problems & Locations**

Property Managers are now able to directly update the Maintenance Problem and Location on all work orders\! Keeping this information accurate reduces Service Provider confusion and results in faster work order completion. Additionally, Latchel monitors which types of work orders get changed most often to improve work order submission accuracy.

2. **Problem & Location Default Behavior Controls**

Property Managers can now update the **“default”** severity setting in Latchel. Traditionally, work orders start in "Needs Approval" unless a setting is explicitly set. Now, the default can be an Emergency\! This option is best for customers on emergency only services and want to err on the side of treating things as an emergency unless they say otherwise.

3. **Integration Source Address**

Integrations customers can now rely on Latchel to sync and maintain the EXACT address from their property management system.The synced address is searchable in Latchel and matches the integration address, ensuring that any property or building names used in your property management system are reflected in Latchel. Additionally, the system maintains the adjusted Latchel address to ensure mapping and communication accuracy.

### **Resolved Bugs**

**Invoice Filtering Fix**

Previously users could not filter for unpaid invoices processed outside of Latchel. Now you can now filter for these invoices using the **"Submitted"** filter.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Emergency Escalation Callback Update**

We clarified our process on how to handle requests from property managers to call them back about emergency situations. Here's an overview of our updated emergency escalation procedures.

- **For Emergencies concerning property damage or extreme habitability (e.g. life threatening) issues,** three sequential call attempts will be made to customers, with immediate SMS follow-up. If property managers request a call back later, we will keep the emergency open until the same-day follow-up call is made.
- **Non-Property Damage and Non-Extreme Habitability Issues** only get one call attempt per follow-up, with SMS notification if unsuccessful.

2. **Estimates and Structural Alterations**

Latchel always stands behind our budget approval process and covers the cost difference on any bill that Latchel improperly approves. Recently, we found a situation where we gave an incorrect verbal approval and ended up paying the excess billed amount on our customer's behalf. In response, we've enhanced our processes and retrained our team on handling budget increase requests when a service provider gives an hourly rate but no firm time completion estimate.
