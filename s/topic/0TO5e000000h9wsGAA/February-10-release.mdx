2. **Maintenance Problem Confirmation\!**

Residents and Latchel Agents now have an enhanced opportunity to verify the accuracy of diagnostic questionnaires. A new popup reminder appears for users to confirm if the problem category of a work order is correct. These updates help us proactively identify potential errors, and have already **improved diagnostic accuracy by 38%\!**

3. **Full Work Order Edit Control**

Property Managers can now edit work orders when they are in the "Waiting for PM" and "Forwarded to PM" states. They also have the ability to edit the "Summary" field directly from the Quick View tab. Previously, outdates restrictions limits these actions. Enjoy the convenience of these new editing capabilities\!

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **System Messaging No Longer Sharing Property Manager Names**

We recently resolved an issue where our automated system messaging inadvertently included the property manager's name in a response to one resident's questions. We have since updated our system to ensure this sensitive information always remains confidential.

2. **No Cancelation Communication**

We recently addressed a bug concerning cancelation notifications not being sent to assigned service providers for work orders under certain situations. We have fixed this issue to ensure that cancelation notification are always sent promptly, improving communication and preventing unnecessary dispatch situation in the future.

### **Key Process Changes**

**Heating Emergencies: Vulnerable vs Non-vulnerable Residents**

To enhance our service and decision-making for emergency responses related to heating issues during extreme outdoor temperatures, we've updated our operations process. This new process involves assessing whether vulnerable individuals are present in a household to determine emergency priorities. Insufficient heating issues will now be classified as emergencies at an indoor temperature threshold of  64°F if vulnerable individuals are present, or at 60°F if they are not.

  Latchel uses both temperature thresholds and severity levels to determine when an HVAC issue qualifies as an emergency. This guide explains how these two settings interact to ensure urgent situations are handled appropriately without unnecessary escalations.

Additionally, we've added new troubleshooting steps to aid residents in locating their heating systems and outlined subsequent actions if a system cannot be found. This ensures we maintain alignment with property manager severity settings while effectively addressing heating issues during extreme weather conditions\!
