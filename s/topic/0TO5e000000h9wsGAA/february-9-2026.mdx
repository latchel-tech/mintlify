The following are the Latchel updates for the week of February 9, 2026.

### **New Features**

1. **New Service: Non-Maintenance Emergencies, like security concerns, noise complaints and more!**

We have a new service that allows you to use Latchel for more than just maintenance! We can receive and route emergency issues to your team. This is commonly used for noise complaints, smoking violations, or other situations where you might want an urgent response from a security team or on-site management. We call this **Latchel On-Call**.

**Build Schedules That Match Real Life**

You can choose who to be contacted for these situations, either full day coverage rotating between team members or with specific time of day or day of week Calendar Rotations.

Calendar Rotations let you define **weekly time-slot coverage**, making it easy to support:

- Weekday vs weekend coverage
- After-hours shifts
- Complex or variable schedules

**Easily Cover Vacations & Sick Days**

You now mark On-Call Contacts as **absent** and optionally assign a substitute. Absences automatically apply across **all rotations**, so coverage stays intact without manual updates.

**Faster Response with Multiple Contact Layers**

Notify multiple technicians **before escalation** to backups or management:

- Alert technicians **sequentially**
- Or notify technicians **simultaneously**

This helps ensure urgent issues are picked up faster.

2. **Expanded Analytics: New work order metrics, vendor and property insights**

We’ve added three new sections to Latchel Analytics: Work Order Metrics, Vendor Insights and Property Insights

**Work Order Metrics**

Are you curious how long it takes your service providers to schedule an appointment? Do you know what your missed appointment rate is? These new work order metrics allow you to see how these metrics change over time. Plus you can filter by individual vendor, owner or portfolio to see more granular data.

**Vendor Insights**

This new section allows you to see your best and worst performing vendors along the following categories:

- Scheduling time – how long vendors sit on jobs before scheduling them with your residents. 
- Missed appointment rate 
- Average review score
- Job completion speed

**Property Insights**

See which properties are generating the most work orders, which properties are having recurring issues, and what kinds of emergency work orders your company is receiving.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Editing Sub-Skills Removing Other Skill Categories**

We fixed an issue that could occur when editing Service Provider skill categories and sub-skills.

<Warning>
  **What was happening?**

  When a Service Provider edited sub-skills within one skill category:

  - Other skill categories could be unintentionally removed after saving
  - In some cases, users also saw an error message when adding categories back or continuing edits
  - Canceling edits could sometimes trigger the same issue

  This made it frustrating to safely update skills without needing to re-add categories.
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What’s fixed:**

  Editing sub-skills is now fully stable:

  - Updating or saving sub-skills **no longer removes other skill categories**
  - Adding or restoring categories works as expected
  - Canceling edits no longer changes existing skills
  - Error messages tied to this workflow have been resolved

  You can now confidently update Service Provider skills without unintended changes.
</Check>

2. **Unable to Send Photos via SMS**

We fixed an issue that prevented some Property Managers from sending photo attachments in SMS conversations with vendors. Users were seeing a **“message unable to be delivered”** error even though messaging previously worked and vendors could still send images successfully.

Photo and file attachments can now be sent via SMS as expected across vendor messaging.

### **Key Processes Changes**

1. **New Guidelines for Active PM Management on Work Orders**

We’ve updated our internal processes to make work order ownership clearer and help requests move forward faster.

<Tip>
  **What this means for you?**

  We now use a consistent guideline to identify when a Property Manager is actively managing a work order. This ensures we don’t duplicate efforts or interrupt when you’re already handling the next steps.

  - A work order is considered actively managed when recent activity shows the PM is:
  - Updating the work order or leaving notes
  - Coordinating directly with vendors, residents, or owners
  - Investigating options or requesting Latchel pause while they handle next steps

  If there hasn’t been recent activity, our team will proactively continue moving the work order forward to prevent delays.
</Tip>

<Note>
  **Why this matters?**

  These updates help:

  - Reduce confusion and duplicate outreach
  - Keep work orders progressing smoothly
  - Ensure the right team takes action at the right time

  This process improvement helps us deliver faster, more consistent service across all work orders.
