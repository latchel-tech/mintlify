### **New Features**

1. Webchat Transcripts Available

We have added Latchel webchat support transcripts to the work order detail page, transcripts tab. This gives you full visibility to all communications happening between Latchel and key stakeholders for all their work orders.

2. Monthly Integration Check for Accurate Billing\!

We’ve launched an automated process to verify the number of units in Latchel matches your system of record. A monthly email also notifies the primary Latchel user of the current active unit count before invoicing.

This ensures invoices are always accurate and up-to-date, eliminating discrepancies and saving you time on manual reconciliations. Our system is designed to prevent over-billing, making your billing precise and hassle-free\!

- Current integrations available are: Propertyware, Appfolio, Yardi, Rent Manager and Buildium.
- Using one of these softwares and want to get set up with a direct integration? Reach out to [success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com)

3. **Vendor Public APIs**

### **Resolved Bugs**

**Integration "Source Address" Not Displaying**

We resolved the bug that affected the Source Addresses to not appear in accounts with an active integration.

Now, when on a work order page or property page, you will see both the address used for mapping and communication purposes as well as the source address which is the exact match of what appears in your property management software\!

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **New Help Center Is Live\!**

2. **Handling Common Area Emergencies**

We’ve updated our procedures to enhance how common area emergencies are managed. By including the common area location in the service provider information and access instructions, this information is now directly added to vendor notifications and dashboards. This ensures vendors arrive fully prepared and know exactly where to go.

These improvements eliminate unnecessary delays, prevent confusion, and help ensure work is completed efficiently—saving you time and avoiding the hassle of missed or incomplete appointments.

### **Resident Benefits**

**Introducing the Moving Concierge Welcome SMS\!**

Delivering a peak resident experience starts even before move-in\! If you include Latchel’s Moving Concierge as part of your Resident Benefits, your incoming residents will now receive a welcome text message from us.

This message highlights the free service and allows them to schedule a call with our moving concierge service for stress-free utility setup. It’s one more way we’re helping to make moving easier for your residents\!
