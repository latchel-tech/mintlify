2. **Restricted Resident Views**

Residents now only see the files they upload to a work order. Previously, they had access to all work order files, which raised privacy concerns for some property managers. This update ensures greater control and confidentiality.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Handling Work Orders Awaiting Property Manager Action**

We’ve updated our standard operating procedures to provide clear guidelines for handling work orders awaiting Property Manager (PM) action. **These new steps ensure a more organized and responsive approach when:**

- A resident contacts us after troubleshooting and the work order needs to proceed.
- A service provider checks if a job is still available after we've forwarded the work order to the PM.

In both cases, we will now escalate the situation back to the PM before proceeding. This prevents double dispatches and avoids any conflicting actions the PM may have initiated. We're committed to ensuring smooth and efficient operations for both you and your residents.

2. **Improved Communication Audits**

We've added a check to catch communication issues from incorrect phone numbers, making sure everyone gets important work order updates. Before, we only flagged undelivered texts, but now we also verify if a number can receive SMS and find other ways to reach people if needed. This makes notifications more reliable and reduces missed updates.

### **Resident Benefits**

**Optional Benefits Update**

We're excited to announce a new feature for clients using our optional benefits product on an integration. This feature allows you to automatically disable newly created properties, so your team doesn't have to proactively update each new property in Latchel when you acquire them.

This enhancement streamlines your operations and gives you more time to focus on your growing portfolio.
