### **New Features**

1. **Simplified Intake Settings for Faster Resident Troubleshooting**

We’ve streamlined the **Intake Settings** experience to make it even easier for residents to troubleshoot and submit their issues.

With this latest update, residents will now see **fewer screens** and **clearer step-by-step guidance** when reporting maintenance problems. Each page includes helpful tips to guide them through quick checks—so they can resolve simple issues faster or move on to scheduling support when needed. Example:

This improvement reduces friction, shortens reporting time, and helps our team get to the right resolution more efficiently.

We’re excited to hear how this new flow feels for your residents and teams. As always, your feedback helps us keep improving—so please don’t hesitate to share your thoughts!

2. **Smarter Work Order Titles**

Work orders now come with **auto-generated, descriptive titles**.

Previously available only for resident submissions for customers on Intake Settings, **AI-powered titles now apply to all Tenant Web Form and Property Manager submissions.** Each title is summarized from the issue details (e.g., _“Dryer malfunction assessment”_ instead of _“Appliance issue”_) to make it easier for teams and vendors to identify the problem quickly.

This update reduces confusion, speeds up coordination, and keeps your dashboard organized!

3. **Simpler Invoicing for In-House Vendor**

**Invoice line items are no longer required** for your in-house vendors!

Previously, in-house vendors had to add a “miscellaneous” line item—often just labeled as labor—to submit an invoice. Now, they can **create \$0 invoices using only hours worked**, keeping things cleaner and faster for internal teams.

This update streamlines your workflow and eliminates unnecessary steps for in-house service tracking.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Console Search for Numbers with Dashes**

We’ve fixed an issue where **searching numbers with dashes (“-”) in the console returned no results.**

You can now search numbers **with or without dashes** and see accurate results instantly — no need to edit or reformat the search query.

2. **Apostrophes Displaying as HTML Code**

We’ve resolved an encoding issue that caused **apostrophes in outgoing emails and text messages** to appear as HTML code (e.g., "\*\*&#039 ;\*\*") instead of a **"normal** **apostrophe"** **(')** character.

Messages like **“technician"<u>&#039 ;</u>"s questions”** will now correctly display as **_“technician’s questions”_** across all email and SMS notifications.

3. **Missing Large Invoice Attachments**

We’ve fixed an issue where **invoices with large file sizes or multiple photo attachments** sometimes failed to deliver successfully.

Vendors can now upload and send **larger invoices with multiple attachments** without interruption — ensuring Property Managers receive all documents as expected.

### **Key Process Change**

**Smarter Non-Emergency Handling**

We’ve refined the **non-emergency Autopilot work order process** to cut down on unnecessary outreach and ensure Ops focuses where it matters most.

Previously, our team often made outbound calls or took action on tasks that could be managed automatically. With this update, Ops will now:

- **Follow PM instructions** when an action is explicitly requested.
- **Send quick SMS updates** (with dashboard links) when information is already available.
- **Create tasks for PMs** only when additional action is needed.

This change helps reduce noise, improve efficiency, and keep vendor responsiveness high for true emergencies.
