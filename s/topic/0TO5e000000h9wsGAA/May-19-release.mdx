### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Scheduled Jobs No Longer Move to Pending**

Good news\! We've fixed the issue where residents reporting a problem with a future scheduled work order would cause it to move to the Pending state. Now, the issue is reported to the property manager as a task while keeping the work order on track.

2. **File Download Naming Fix – Smoother, Simpler File Management**

Good news\! We’ve resolved an issue where file downloads included unnecessary characters in the file names. Now, files will download with the exact name displayed in Latchel, making them easier to locate on your device.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **New Troubleshooting Steps– Unsecured Doors**

We’ve updated our troubleshooting process to improve support for your residents. The new **Unsecured Door** category helps troubleshooters quickly identify and resolve common door security issues, including:

- **Physical Alignment**: Checking for gaps, loose hinges, or damaged frames.
- **Lock Functionality:** Testing lock engagement and key or code issues.
- **Electronic Components:** Verifying battery levels and error codes for smart locks.
- **Temporary Safety Measures:** Providing immediate solutions if the issue can’t be fixed remotely.

We’re confident this update will enhance security and streamline support for your residents.

2. **New Customization Available - Recall Vendor Action Set**

We’re excited to introduce a new customization designed to improve service continuity and reduce downtime for your properties – the Recall Vendor Action Set.

**How It Works:**

When a job enters the **“Finding Service Provider”** state, our system will now automatically check for:

- **Recent History**: Any completed jobs at the same property with the same issue category in the past **60 days**.
- **Open Jobs**: Any open jobs with the same category that already have a vendor assigned.

If a match is found, the same vendor is automatically assigned to the new job, ensuring faster resolutions and consistent service quality.

### **Resident Benefits**

1. **Email Residents Drain Pack Claim Form When Experiencing Clogged Drains**

We now automatically email residents the drain pack claim form whenever they submit a work order related to clogged drains\!
