2. **Automatic Notifications for Critical Job Updates**

You asked, we built it\! Now, if you update key job details after a service provider has scheduled an appointment—like the job description, provider instructions, or access info—they’ll get an automatic notification. No more follow-up calls or missed updates. Just clear, up-to-date info before they arrive on site.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **PNG Files Now Open Without Issues**

We’ve fixed a bug that caused some PNG image files to break or not open properly after download. Your maintenance photos and documentation in PNG format will now download and open reliably.

We know file access and previewing could be smoother overall—and we’re actively working on improvements to make interacting with all file types faster and easier in future updates.

2. **Reminder: Latchel Data Sync Now Keeps Disabled Properties Disabled**

**Appfolio users:** We’ve fixed a bug where previously disabled properties in Latchel were being re-enabled during data syncs. Going forward, any property you disable in Latchel will stay disabled—even after a sync—keeping your unit count accurate.

We’ve already bulk-disabled the units affected by this issue. If you disabled properties in Latchel but left them active in Appfolio, double-check your unit count in Latchel. Also, keep an eye out for the automated email we send on the 21st with your active unit count.

Make sure everything looks right before April 30th to ensure your bill is accurate.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Multi Day Appointment Handling**

We’ve updated our processes with new guidelines for handling multi-day job appointments. When a job spans multiple days, Latchel will create a single appointment window covering the full duration (up to 7 days), ensure the service provider contacts the resident daily to confirm arrival, and flag the work order as multi-day so future users are informed. Any updates from the service provider—like delays or schedule changes—will be logged in the job notes to keep everyone aligned and equipped to manage the appointment effectively\!
