### **New Features**

1. **Get early access to Customized Emergency Definitions\!**

Want to define, in your own words, what counts as an emergency, what needs your approval, and what should be dispatched immediately? We’re excited to introduce early access to our new Customized Emergency Definitions feature. Take control over how emergencies are handled for your properties.

2. **Visibility Into Work Order Creation Logic**

Ever wonder **_why_** a work order started in a certain state? Now you don't have to.

We've added **intake processing details** to every new work order’s job log—giving you full transparency into how a work order was created and why it entered a specific state.

You’ll now see a breakdown of key intake checks, such as:

- Problem location validation
- On-call routing decisions
- Warranty and duplicate checks
- Budget limit and responsible party updates
- Final work order state determination

To view this info, just open the **job activity log** and **sort from oldest to newest.** This enhancement helps both our team and yours quickly troubleshoot and understand the “why” behind each job’s workflow.

It’s a small update with a big impact—and just the start of deeper insights as we explore AI-assisted work order logic in the future.

3. **Inspections Are Now Live for All PMs\!**

We’ve launched Inspections — the newest addition to your Maintenance tab. All Property Manager customers now have access to the early version of this feature, including Inspections and Inspection Templates. Click the link below for an overview of how to leverage this new tool\!

  **Your feedback matters.**\
  Since this is an early version, we’d love your input. If there are specific inspection features you'd like to see, or if something’s missing, let us know at [success@latchel.com](mailto:success@latchel.com). We’ll either let you know if it's already on the roadmap or log it as a feature request.

  Stay tuned for the full rollout — and thanks for helping shape what’s next\!

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Full Property Search Results Now Visible**

We fixed an issue where only the first 5 results would show when searching for a property. Now, if more than 5 properties match your search, you’ll see pagination controls (page numbers or arrows) so you can scroll through and find exactly what you need.

This fix applies across multiple workflows—inspections, work order creation, and anywhere you select a property—with a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes:

- On wide screens: full pagination with numbers
- On smaller screens: simplified arrow navigation

No more missing properties or incomplete lists—just a smoother, more flexible search experience wherever you need it.

2. **Residents Can Now Add Images & Videos Anytime (Until Completion)**

We’ve just made it easier for residents to keep you fully informed.

Residents can now upload photos and videos to any open work order—at any time, as long as it hasn’t been completed or canceled. This gives them the flexibility to provide more context after the initial submission, helping ensure your vendors and team have everything they need to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently

This update was inspired by direct customer feedback (shoutout to Wizbang\!) and is already live in the platform.
