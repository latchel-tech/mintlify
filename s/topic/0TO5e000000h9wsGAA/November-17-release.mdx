### **New Features**

1. **AI Generated Work Order Summaries**

We’ve made it easier than ever to stay on top of work orders!

With our new **Work Order Activity Summaries**, both **Latchel and Property Manager** **users** can now click **“Summarize”** at the top of the Activity log to generate a clear overview of what’s happened so far — plus any **open tasks** that still need attention.

**Want to help us make it even better?**

You can now click **"Provide Feedback"** right inside the **Summary** to share your thoughts directly with our team.

2. **Work Order Imports Now Off by Default (Rentvine & Buildium)**

We’ve made an important change to how **Rentvine** and **Buildium** work orders connect with Latchel.

Based on recent feedback, **Latchel will no longer automatically import work orders** from Rentvine or Buildium into our system by default.

If your account needs work order imports enabled, just let us know — **our CS/PS teams can submit a quick request to Engineering** to turn them on for you.

This change helps ensure cleaner data, better control, and more flexibility for customers managing maintenance across multiple platforms.

3. **Exclude Properties from Latchel Data Sync**

Property Managers now have more control over what gets imported into Latchel.

Based on customer feedback, we’ve added an **“Exclude from Property Sync”** option within supported property management systems (PMS). This allows users to **exclude specific units**—such as commercial spaces, non-revenue units, parking spots, or storage units—from being imported to Latchel.

This enhancement helps maintain cleaner data and ensures that only relevant properties are synced for maintenance management.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. Character Limit on Default Access Instructions

We’ve removed the character limit that previously restricted the amount of text that could be entered in **Default Access Instructions**.

This fix allows users to include **more detailed entry notes and access directions**, ensuring technicians and vendors receive all the necessary information for smoother service visits.

2. **Image Review Links in Tasks**

We resolved an issue where the **“Review Images”** links in tasks didn’t correctly open the Files tab within Latchel. The links have been fixed — all new task links now open the intended Files tab as expected.
