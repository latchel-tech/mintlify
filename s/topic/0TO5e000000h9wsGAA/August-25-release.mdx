### **New Features**

1. **Merge Work Orders**

We’re excited to announce a new feature launching tomorrow for **Autopilot customers**: the ability to **merge work orders**. This update helps property managers streamline maintenance by combining related requests, reducing duplicate dispatches, and saving on unnecessary trip fees.

<Check>
  **What You Can Do**

  - Merge a new, **non-emergency work order** into another open work order at the same property using the **“Merge Work Order”** option in the Action dropdown.
  - Review all fields and details that will be merged before submitting.
  - See clear records in the **job logs** of both the parent (original) and child (merged) work orders, including who merged them and any notes added.
  - View previously merged work orders in the **Cancelled / Archive** section of the Kanban view.
</Check>

<Note>
  **When You Can Merge**

  Property Managers can merge a new work order (child) into an existing one (parent) if:

  - There is another **open**, **non-archived** work order at the same property.
  - The new work order is **not an emergency**.
  - The new work order does **not already have a service provider assigned**.
</Note>

We’re excited to roll this out and have more improvements on the way, like smart suggestions for when work orders should be merged.

2. **Free upgrade to fully customizable Intake Settings\!**

Latchel now offers Property Managers increased customization of emergency definitions along with a dynamic intake experience designed to troubleshoot and de-escalate maintenance issues **of any severity**. Due to the positive response we’ve received over the past couple weeks, **_Latchel is now offering this upgrade for free\!_**

This new feature includes:

- Create flexible, custom emergency rules in **plain language** to define what should be an emergency, non-emergency or require your approval before dispatching
- **Test your rules** against any maintenance issue
- Easily create, edit or delete rules based on **your desired intake outcome**
- Residents enjoy an intuitive **intake experience dynamically generate**d based on your Intake Settings and the specific responses they provide at each step of the flow

Now **even your non-emergencies get enhanced troubleshooting during intake\!** (A follow-up call from our team and video troubleshooting with residents is still reserved for emergency issues only.)

3. **Enhanced File Upload Notifications**

We’ve made file upload notifications more informative\!

Previously, you may have seen generic messages like **_“Images have been uploaded”_**. Now, notifications will clearly tell you who uploaded the files to a work order.

**Examples:**

- _A resident has uploaded images_
- _Latchel has uploaded images_
- _A service provider has uploaded images_

This update provides better visibility into work order activity, so you’ll always know where new files are coming from.

This enhancement is already live in production—no action needed on your end.
