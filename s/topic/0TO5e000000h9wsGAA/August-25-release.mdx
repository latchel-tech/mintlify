### **New Features**

1. **Merge Work Orders**

We’re excited to announce a new feature for **Autopilot customers** (and Latchel users taking action on their behalf): the ability to **merge work orders**. This update helps property managers streamline maintenance by combining related requests, reducing duplicate dispatches, and saving on unnecessary trip fees.

<Check>
  **What You Can Do**

  - Merge a new, **non-emergency work order** into another open work order at the same property using the **“Merge Work Order”** option in the Action dropdown.
  - Review all fields and details that will be merged before submitting.
  - See clear records in the **job logs** of both the parent (original) and child (merged) work orders, including who merged them and any notes added.
  - View previously merged work orders in the **Cancelled / Archive** section of the Kanban view.
</Check>

<Note>
  **When You Can Merge**

  Property Managers can merge a new work order (child) into an existing one (parent) if:

  - There is another open, non-archived work order at the same property.
  - The new work order is **not an emergency**.
  - The new work order does **not already have a service provider assigned**.
</Note>

We’re excited to roll this out and have more improvements on the way, like smart suggestions for when work orders should be merged.

2. **Fully Customized Intake Settings**

With Harmonia, you can now replace the old **Severity/Responsibility** and **Emergency Temperature Settings** with one powerful, customizable system:

- Write **plain-language rules** to define emergencies, non-emergencies, or “approval required” cases. In addition to Emergency and Normal, PMs can now configure:
  - **Urgent** – vendor dispatched with a 72-hour scheduling window.
  - **Resident Responsible** – work order canceled with resident notified they are responsible (with clear messaging to remove confusion).
- **Test rules instantly** by entering any maintenance issue.
- Easily **create, edit, or delete** rules at any time.
- Apply rule sets at the **company, portfolio, or property level** for maximum flexibility.
- Review a full **log of rules processed** and their outcomes for each work order.
- **Improved Clarity:** Labels now show both the severity and the next action that will take place (e.g., _“Emergency – Live Agent Troubleshooting”_).
- **Simplified Outcome Descriptions:** When editing rules, outcomes are now clearly labeled without long-form explanations, making them easier to understand and select.

**Smarter Resident Intake**

**Harmonia X** transforms how residents submit requests:

- **AI-generated intake flow** tailored to your rules and the resident’s responses.
- **Built-in troubleshooting** helps de-escalate issues before dispatch.
- **Call Center Submissions:** The Harmonia X intake experience is now also available when residents call in, giving them the same guided flow as the online dashboard.
- Automatically determines the **Work Order Skill** with confidence ratings (High, Medium, Low).
  - If confidence is Low, a task is created for Troubleshooters to review and assign.

Supports **Spanish language intake** (triggered by a resident writing in Spanish).
