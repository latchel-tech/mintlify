### **New Features**

1. **No More Double Notifications for Uploaded Invoices**

We’ve streamlined your notification experience to reduce noise and eliminate redundant alerts—making it easier to stay focused on what matters.

**Cleaner, Simpler Invoice Notifications**

Previously, when a service provider uploaded an invoice, Property Managers received **two notifications**:

- An email alert
- A task prompting them to review associated images

For PMs with task notifications enabled, this resulted in duplicate alerts for the exact same action.

<Check>
  **What’s Changed**:

  To simplify and reduce unnecessary interruptions:

  - **PMs will now receive a single email notification** when an invoice is uploaded.
  - **No additional task will be created** for image review.
  - All invoice details and images remain easily accessible within the work order.
</Check>

This change removes redundant alerts and creates a cleaner workflow for PMs—helping your team stay efficient and avoid notification fatigue.

2. **Building-Level Common Area Work Orders—Plus a Preview of What’s Coming Next**

Managing maintenance for shared spaces just got easier. Latchel now supports **building-level (common area) work orders** for every integration platform—giving Property Managers a streamlined way to handle jobs like landscaping, garbage removal, elevator maintenance, hallway issues, and more.

**A Better Way to Manage Common Area Maintenance**

Until now, work orders required a specific unit. But many maintenance needs occur at the **building level**, not inside an individual apartment or home. Property Managers can now request a **Common Area Unit** for any building, allowing them to:

- Create work orders for shared spaces
- Track building-level maintenance history
- Keep unit-level reporting clean and separate
- Ensure vendors receive accurate property details

**Want to enable common area work orders?**

**Coming Soon: Recurring Maintenance Work Orders (Beta)**

Do you have **recurring maintenance** on your buildings—like lawn care, common area cleaning, or routine inspections?

We’re currently preparing a **Recurring Work Orders** feature that will allow you to automate repeat maintenance on a schedule, instead of recreating the same work orders over and over.

**Want Early Access?** Join our **Recurring Maintenance beta program** and help influence the final design.

3. **Faster, Easier Intake Settings Setup: Duplicate Rule Sets Now Available**

Configuring Intake Settings during onboarding just became significantly simpler. Whether you're setting up a brand new portfolio or tailoring rules for a specific property, our newest enhancement streamlines the entire process for both Latchel teams and Property Managers.

**Introducing: Duplicate Rule Sets**

Previously, creating a customized rule set meant manually recreating each rule one-by-one—a time-consuming and tedious process.\
Now, you can **duplicate any existing rule set** with a single click, then simply adjust the specific rules you want to change.

<Tip>
  **Here’s How It Helps:**\
  \
  With the new **Duplicate Rule Sets** feature, you can:

  - **Start with a complete copy** of an existing rule set
  - **Quickly adjust a single rule** (e.g., lockout responsibility, HVAC temperature thresholds)
  - **Avoid repetitive copy-paste setup steps**
  - **Create portfolio- or property-specific rule sets in seconds**
</Tip>

Once duplicated, the new rule set is **not applied automatically**. PMs or Latchel team members can then assign it to the specific property or portfolio where it should be used—keeping everything clean and intentional.

This enhancement is part of our ongoing effort to elevate the entire Intake Settings experience for users on both sides of the platform.

### **Key Process Change**

1. **Handling Work Orders Awaiting PM Action**

We’ve updated our internal workflow to ensure follow-ups and severity changes on work orders are handled with greater clarity, consistency, and visibility.

<Check>
  **What's New:**

  - **Consistent follow-up handling.**\
    When a resident, owner, or service provider contacts us for an update, Ops will provide the current status _and_ create a task for the PM so they are notified of the request.
  - **Improved handling of severity changes.**\
    If the work order’s severity escalates or de-escalates—based on new information or PM settings—Ops will restore and follow the standard task guidelines. This ensures PMs are notified when needed and emergency workflows are triggered appropriately.
</Check>

These updates help ensure communication remains smooth, severity changes are handled properly, and PMs receive clear, timely notifications when action is required.
