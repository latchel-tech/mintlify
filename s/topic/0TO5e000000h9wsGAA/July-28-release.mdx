### **New Features**

1. **Residents Can Now Upload Photos ANYTIME\!**

We’ve made it even easier for property managers to get full visibility into maintenance issues — **even after a work order is completed or cancelled. Residents can now** **add images and videos to a work order at any time.**

Once a resident uploads a file, **you’ll automatically receive a task notification** letting you know that “**Work Order Images are Ready for Review**.”

**Not Receiving These Notifications? Here’s How to Turn Them On:**

2. **No More “Unhandled Error” When Adding Existing Service Providers**

Adding a service provider just got way smoother.

Previously, when a property manager attempted to add a service provider that already existed in the Latchel system, they’d go through the entire setup process — only to be hit with a vague **“Unhandled Error”** at the end.

**Now, that’s fixed\!**

If the service provider already exists in Latchel, the platform will:

- **Pre-populate the service provider’s existing information**
- **Allow the PM to add them to their vendor list without errors**
- **Save everyone time and confusion**

If any contact or skill updates are needed, PMs can still reach out to Latchel Support for assistance — but they’ll no longer be blocked from adding providers due to email conflicts or duplicate entries.

This update reduces friction and gives property managers a clearer, more efficient experience managing their vendor lists\!

3. **Latchel Data Sync Just Got Smarter — And Easier to Manage**

We’ve made important updates to improve your **Latchel Data Sync** experience, giving you more control over manual syncs — and solving a common issue that may be stopping your auto sync from running in the background.

<Check>
  **New Manual Sync Options:**

  When you perform a manual Latchel Data Sync, you’ll now see two clear options:

  - Latchel → Platform
  - Both Directions
</Check>

**To know more about this cool manual sync update, visit:**

This eliminates confusion about what data is being synced and helps ensure the right info is flowing between systems — whether you’re syncing work orders into your platform or refreshing data back into Latchel.

**Chrome could be blocking your auto sync\!** Follow the steps from the help guide below to prevent Chrome from blocking your data to auto sync.

### **Resolved Bugs**

**Estimates Within the Approved Budget Will No Longer Trigger “Needs Approval”**

We’ve resolved an issue that was causing unnecessary delays for property managers when reviewing estimates — even when those estimates were well within the approved budget.

<Warning>
  **What was happening?**

  Even when a **pre-approved budget** (e.g. \$550) was already set, the system was incorrectly flagging estimates that were **below that amount** (e.g. \$500) and moving the work order into a **“Needs Approval”** state.

  This happened when the **approved budget** entered by the PM was _higher than the hard budget limit_ — and the system didn’t recognize the higher amount during review, causing confusion and requiring extra manual approvals.
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What's New:**

  We’ve updated the system logic so that it now checks both:

  - The **hard budget limit**
  - The **PM-approved budget**
</Check>

As long as the **estimate is below either of these two limits**, the work order will now **auto-approve as expected** — no more manual intervention needed. This fix helps reduce approval delays, eliminates unnecessary steps, and gives your team more confidence that budgets will behave as expected\!

### **Key Process Changes**

**New Workflow for PM Input on Work Orders**

We’ve made an important update to how work orders are handled when they require **input or action from the Property Manager**. This change is designed to **reduce delays, improve clarity**, and **avoid unnecessary status transitions**.

<Check>
  **What's Changing:**

  Previously, there were several scenarios where it was acceptable to move a work order to **“Waiting for PM”** status whenever additional input was needed.

  Going forward, instead of changing the work order status, Latchel will:

  - Keep the work order in its current state
  - Create a task for the PM requesting the information or action needed
    - To ensure urgency and consistency, Latchel will use this format when creating the task: **Action Required: PM Instructions or Information Needed**
</Check>

Moving a Work Order into a  **“Waiting for PM”** status will now only be used in the following, approved scenarios:

1. The PM has explicitly requested that the work order be moved to “Waiting for PM.”
2. A vendor cannot be sourced after reasonable attempts.
3. PM coordination is required for unit access or resident/property involvement.
4. The work order was created by the PM for a background task they are managing.
5. The issue is property-damaging or habitability-related, and all escalation steps have already been taken.
