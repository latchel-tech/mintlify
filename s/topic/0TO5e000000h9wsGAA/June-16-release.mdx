2. **Organize Inspection Items by Area\!**

You can now organize your inspection list items by specific areas of the property—like _Kitchen, Bedroom 1, Bathroom 2,_ or even custom ones like _Barn_ or _Backyard_. This added flexibility makes it easier than ever to tailor inspection templates to each unique property and streamline the inspection experience for both Property Managers and Vendors.

  **What's New:**

  - Add and customize item areas within templates.
  - Organize inspection items under designated areas for clarity.
  - Easily move items between areas or create new ones on the fly.
  - Areas display alphabetically for now (custom ordering coming soon\!).
  - Inspectors now see grouped items in a mobile-friendly layout with area-specific progress tracking.

This update enhances clarity, saves time, and makes inspections easier to manage and complete—both in the office and out in the field.

### **Key Process Change**

1. **Smarter Garage Door Troubleshooting**

To improve first-touch resolution and reduce unnecessary dispatches, we’ve updated our processes for unresponsive garage door openers.

<Check>
  **What’s new:**

  Agents are now instructed to guide residents through checking and resetting the GFCI outlet in the garage—a frequently overlooked fix that often restores power to the garage door opener.
</Check>

This added step ensures a common cause of power loss is ruled out before escalating or assigning a vendor, saving time for both residents and teams.

2. **Updated Inbound Call Greeting**

To reduce customer confusion, we’ve updated the **Inbound Call Greeting**.

Latchel associates will no longer mention **“Latchel”** when answering calls. Instead, agents will refer to it as the **“maintenance line.”** This helps maintain clarity for residents and owners who may not recognize the Latchel name.

<Check>
  **Updated Standard Greeting:**

  _“Thanks for calling the recorded maintenance line. This is [Your Name]. How can we help you?”_
</Check>

This change ensures a smoother, more professional first impression on every call.
