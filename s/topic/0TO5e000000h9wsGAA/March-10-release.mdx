### **New Features**

1. **Improved Latchel Data Sync**

Good news\! With our latest extension update **(version 3.0.6)**, the Latchel Data Sync now runs **98% faster**—reducing the average sync time from nearly 3 minutes to just ~11 seconds for Appfolio Integration property managers. This means quicker updates, smoother operations, and less waiting for your data to sync.

2. **Rapid Resident SMS Response\!**

Late last year, we set out to improve our response time for residents requesting help via text message. We’re happy to report that we’ve reduced the average response time by 65%—from approximately 29 seconds to just over 10 seconds. We share your passion for delivering a best-in-class resident experience\!

3. **Resident Work Order Description Now More Visible**

We’ve made an important update to improve the work order intake experience\! The resident’s description (provided during work order submission) will now be displayed more prominently for all Latchel users.

**Why?**

- Users find these details valuable for quicker issue resolution.
- Many residents take the time to describe their maintenance issues clearly, and this enhancement ensures their input is more visible and accessible.

A small change with a big impact—helping ensure work orders are handled more efficiently.

### **Resolved Bugs**

**Owner Settings Updates Now Logged\!**

Previously, changes to owner settings weren’t logged—making it harder to track updates and diagnose issues. Now, all owner settings updates are logged directly in the owner’s profile\! This improvement provides better transparency to quickly identify and resolve issues.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Resident Benefit Responses, Less Work for You\!**

Latchel is here to lighten your workload by handling benefit-related inquiries directly with residents. In the past, these were routed through the Property Manager, creating extra steps and delays. Now, **our skilled agents will communicate directly with residents via email,** removing unnecessary intermediaries. This means fewer tasks for you and faster, more efficient interactions for residents\!

2. **Clearer Emergency Communication with Service Providers**

We’ve updated our processes to improve communication during emergencies. All communication with Service Providers regarding emergency work orders will now explicitly include the term "emergency" to highlight urgency. This applies when sourcing new providers and scheduling emergency appointments to ensure faster scheduling.
