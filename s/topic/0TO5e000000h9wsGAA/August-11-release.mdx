### **New Features**

**Get access to enhanced troubleshooting for non-emergencies and a more customizable Intake experience\!**

Latchel now offers Property Managers increased customization of emergency definitions along with a dynamic intake experience designed to troubleshoot and de-escalate maintenance issues **of any severity**. That’s right, you will get enhanced step-by-step troubleshooting on every call even if it is a non-emergency. This enhanced troubleshooting feature is only \$0.50/unit extra for Latchel customers. 

This new feature includes:

- Create flexible, custom emergency rules in **plain language** to define what should be an emergency, non-emergency or require your approval before dispatching
- **Test your rules** against any maintenance issue
- Easily create, edit or delete rules based on **your desired intake outcome**
- Residents enjoy an intuitive **intake experience dynamically generate**d based on your Intake Settings and the specific responses they provide at each step of the flow

Now **even your non-emergencies get enhanced troubleshooting during intake for an extra \$0.50 per unit per month\! **(A follow-up call from our team and video troubleshooting with residents is still reserved for emergency issues only.)

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **No More Tag Prompts on Already-Tagged Conversations**

We’ve fixed a bug that was causing unnecessary interruptions when ending SMS conversations.

<Warning>
  **What was happening?**\
  \
  Property Managers were being prompted to “tag the conversation” even when tags were already applied. This created confusion and extra steps, preventing the conversation from properly closing.
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What’s fixed:**\
  \
  Now, if a conversation is already tagged, you can hit **End Conversation** without any pop-up messages. Quick, clean, and done.
</Check>

**Shoutout:**\
Big thanks to **Key Renter St. Louis West** for reporting this bug\!

2. **Clearer Error Message When Adding Existing Users as Service Providers**

We’ve improved how we communicate a rare issue to make the next steps more straightforward. 

<Warning>
  **What was happening?**\
  \
  If you tried to add someone already in the system (like a resident or PM) as a Service Provider, you’d hit a vague error with no clear next step.
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What’s new:**\
  \
  You’ll now see a clear message that explains the issue and guides you to contact support if you need help. 
</Check>

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Resident Notifications for Recall Cancellations**

We’ve made a small but important update to how we handle duplicate or recall work orders—so your residents aren’t left in the dark.

<Warning>
  **What’s changing?**\
  \
  In the past, when we canceled a new work order because it was a recall, residents weren’t always formally notified. Now, they’ll always get a heads-up when a request is closed out as a recall..
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What this means for you:**\
  \
  No more confusion or follow-up from residents wondering why their request disappeared. You can count on us to keep communication clear and consistent.
</Check>

2. **Clarifying Follow-Ups When the Property Manager or Escalation Contact Is Also the Service Provider**

We’ve clarified a key process to ensure smoother coordination and reduce confusion during emergency maintenance situations.

<Warning>
  **What’s changing?**\
  \
  Sometimes, a service provider is also listed as the Property Manager (PM) or Emergency Escalation Contact (EEC). We’ve trained our team and created a clear process for handling these cases.
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What’s new:**\
  \
  The updated process now clearly states:

  - If the service provider is also the PM or EEC, we’ll still follow our usual communication process—no confusion.
  - For Property Damaging (PD) or Emergency Habitability (EH) cases, we’ll resolve everything in one call—no need for additional outreach.

  **What this means for you:**\
  \
  You can count on consistent communication and timely updates—even when your preferred provider also fills other roles in your account setup.
</Check>

3. **Streamlined Task Creation for Work Order Escalations**

We’ve cleaned up an internal process to make sure we handle emergency escalations faster and more clearly.

<Warning>
  **What’s changing?**\
  \
  Before, our team sometimes created tasks even when they weren’t needed. That slowed things down. Now, tasks will only be created if there’s follow-up required—like reaching out to a vendor or rescheduling a job.
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What this means for you:**

  Quicker responses during emergencies, better focus from our team, and the same reliable support—just with a smoother process behind the scenes.
</Check>

**Not Receiving These Notifications? Here’s How to Turn Them On:**
