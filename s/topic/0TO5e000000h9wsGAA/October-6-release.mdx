### **New Features**

1. **Intake Creates Multiple Work Orders**

We’re excited to share a powerful enhancement now live for all **Property Managers who have upgraded to the FREE Custom Intake Settings feature**:

**Intake can now automatically detect and create multiple work orders from a single resident submission.**

**How It Works**

When a resident submits a request, the intake system will detect if multiple issues need to be addressed. For example:

- **Leak reported** → Generate a work order for the leak repair.
- **Water damage discovered** → Automatically generate an additional work order for remediation.

These related work orders are grouped into a **Project**, making it easy to track and manage the entire scope of work from start to finish.

**Why It Matters**

- **Fewer misses:** No more manual follow-up work orders for secondary issues.
- **Better organization:** Related jobs are automatically tied together in one Project.
- **Faster response:** Intake ensures all issues are captured upfront, reducing delays.

This update is live now—helping property managers save time while ensuring residents’ needs are fully addressed.

2. **Enhanced Troubleshooting During Intake**

The latest upgrade to the FREE **Custom Intake Settings** feature brings you **Enhanced Troubleshooting**—an improved way to capture critical details during intake.

**This enhancement builds on our former diagnostic flow and goes further, adding smarter troubleshooting for key issues like structural leaks, plumbing leaks, and remediation.**

**How It Works**

When a resident submits a request, the intake flow now automatically runs through advanced troubleshooting steps to gather more detail and guide the resident. Examples include:

- Identifying the exact location of a plumbing or structural leak.
- Helping residents shut off water or contain a leak where possible.
- Capturing potential follow-up needs (like remediation after water damage).

This enhanced troubleshooting can prevent work orders from even needing to be created, but when they do, the increased detail provides you and your vendors with the most complete information available., It also pairs seamlessly with our new **automatic multiple work order creation** feature when additional jobs are needed.

**Why It Matters**

- **Better clarity upfront:** More precise intake details help Service Providers arrive better prepared.
- **Proactive issue detection:** Intake now checks for related damage or follow-up needs.
- **Smarter troubleshooting:** Expanded prompts reduce back-and-forth between your team, residents, and vendors.

  - **Use the SP view for training purposes**, giving staff insight into how vendors experience the platform.
  - **Gain better overall visibility** into the flow of work orders from all perspectives.
