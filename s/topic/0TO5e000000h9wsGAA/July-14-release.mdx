### **New Features**

1. **Support for Puerto Rico Properties\!**

We're excited to announce that **users can now add properties located in Puerto Rico\!**

This update comes in response to a request from one of our valued customers, E-Support, and we're thrilled to make it available to all active clients.

- **"PR - Puerto Rico"** is now available in the state dropdown menu when adding or editing property addresses.
- **Full support for Puerto Rico service territories** is confirmed and operational.
- **Phone and SMS communication** with residents and service providers in Puerto Rico is fully supported.

Thank you for your continued feedback—your suggestions help us grow and improve\!

2. **Mobile Update: Easier Job Scheduling for Service Providers**

We’ve made a small but **impactful design update** to improve how service providers engage with available jobs on **mobile\!**

<Check>
  **What's New:**

  - The **call-to-action to schedule jobs** now features a clear border on mobile, making it more visible and easier to tap.
  - Previously, the prompt blended into the background due to color changes between desktop and mobile views—this fix ensures it now stands out.

This enhancement helps your service providers respond faster to new jobs, keeping work orders moving without delay.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Accurate Unit Counts in Property Search**

We’ve fixed an issue affecting the property search bar display for larger portfolios.

<Warning>
  **What was happening:**

  Customers with more than 1,000 units were seeing a generic message: “Search 1000 Properties.”
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What’s Fixed:**\
  \
  The search bar now correctly reflects the actual number of active units in your account.

  For example: **“Search 1,150 Properties.”**
</Check>

This ensures better visibility into your portfolio and a more accurate user experience.

2. **Non-Emergency WOs Now Routing Correctly**

We’ve fixed an issue affecting **emergency-only customers.**

<Warning>
  **What was happening:**

  Non-emergency work orders were incorrectly being routed to **“Needs Approval”** instead of the correct state: **“Forwarded to PM.”**
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What’s Fixed:**

  All non-emergency work orders for emergency-only customers now bypass **“Needs Approval”** and go directly to **“Forwarded to PM”** as expected.
</Check>

This fix helps ensure your workflow stays smooth and aligned with your service preferences.

3. **"Create List" Button for Blank Inspection Templates**

We’ve resolved an issue that was preventing customers from creating blank inspection templates.

<Warning>
  **What was happening:**\
  \
  When attempting to build a blank inspection template, the “Create List” button appeared inactive, blocking progress.
</Warning>

<Check>
  **What’s Fixed:**\
  \
  You can now successfully create blank inspection templates without issue—making it easier to build inspections from scratch.
</Check>

**As we continue to enhance the Inspections feature, we’d love to hear what tools or improvements would be most helpful to you.**
