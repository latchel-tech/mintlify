2. **File Thumbnails for Work Orders**

Preview images at a glance with **file thumbnails**, now live on all **Work Order** file uploads and file tabs.

No more guessing filenames—just scan the thumbnails to quickly find what you need, from **photos and estimates to QR codes and receipts**.

3. **Owner Denial Notifications for Property Managers**

Property Managers will now receive a **notification when an owner denies a work order or budget increase request**.

Previously, these denials could go unnoticed, leading to canceled work orders and delays. Now, the work order will be **flagged** so PMs can take the necessary next steps and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

<Note>
  Make sure you have **task notifications turned on** to receive these notifications\! **Here’s how to check:** 

  1. Go to your **Account Settings**.
  2. Click the **Users** tab. 
  3. Click the **specific user** to check on the notification settings. 
  4. Once on that user profile page, review the **Contact Settings** and confirm the **Task notifications toggle** is turned **ON**. 
</Note>

This update helps keep operations smooth and issues addressed without delay.

4. **Buildium Integration: 2-Way Work Order Sync\!**

Latchel users with Buildium Premium subscriptions or access to Buildium’s API can now have properties, residents and work orders fully sync between Latchel and Buildium\!

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **AppFolio Work Orders Landing in the Wrong Stage**

We’ve resolved an issue that affected how some AppFolio work orders synced into Latchel.

**The Issue:** \
Some work orders were incorrectly starting in **"Finding Service Provider"** instead of **"Diagnosing** **Issue."** Residents weren’t prompted to answer diagnostic questions, and a maintenance problem wasn’t assigned, preventing the system from matching the job to the right vendor.

**The Fix:**\
Work orders will now only start in **"Finding Service Provider"** if the synced AppFolio job is marked as **vacant**. For properties with residents, work orders will correctly start in **"Diagnosing Issue"** so we can collect all needed details upfront and ensure a smooth, efficient workflow.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Updated Troubleshooting for Clogged Drains**

We've added a new step to the Clogged Sink Drain troubleshooting questions. If the trap was removed with the resident’s permission, Latchel now provides clear guidance on reattaching it safely, helping prevent leaks and property damage. This ensures safer, more reliable fixes. 

2. **Property Enablement Process Update**

We’ve updated how we handle property activation requests to reduce delays and keep your operations running smoothly.

<Check>
  **What’s new:**

  If the request comes from an **unlisted Property Manager**, we’ll escalate it to the Success Team to confirm authorization before proceeding. (This ensures accuracy since billing is per property unit.)
</Check>

**Suggested Action:**

Ensure all property management points of contact are listed as users in Latchel so we know they are authorized to add or activate units in Latchel.
