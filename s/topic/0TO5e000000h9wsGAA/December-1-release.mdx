### **New Features**

1. **Customized Intake Settings Active for All Property Managers by 12/3/25**

We’re excited to share that **all property managers will officially be transitioned to Latchel’s new customized intake settings by Wednesday, December 3rd!** This upgrade enhances how our system evaluates and troubleshoots maintenance requests—ensuring faster clarity, better routing, and improved accuracy for both emergency and non-emergency work orders.

<Check>
  **What This Means for You**

  - **Improved troubleshooting** is now applied to every work order submitted through Latchel.
  - You’ll see **more precise emergency rule definitions**, helping ensure the right response at the right time.
  - When logged into your Latchel dashboard, you can now **review and provide feedback** on the troubleshooting questions we ask—allowing you to fine-tune how our system handles unique situations for your portfolio.

We’re thrilled to bring these enhancements to your workflow and look forward to helping you make the most of them!

2. **Modernized Intake Experience for Synced Work Orders**

We’re excited to share that **all work orders submitted through an integration or API sync from your property management system will now use the same enhanced Custom Intake Settings experience your teams are already familiar with.**

Previously, when a work order synced in and required additional resident details, the resident received a prompt that directed them to our older intake flow. With this update:

- **Residents will now receive the upgraded Custom Intake flow** whenever more information is needed on a synced work order
- **The experience is mobile-friendly, faster, and more intuitive**, ensuring residents can easily provide the information required to move the request forward
- **Property managers get more complete and accurate intake details**, improving dispatch speed and reducing back-and-forth communication

This update ensures a consistent and modern experience across **all** work order types—whether created directly or synced from your Property Management Software.

3. **Fresh New Look: Updated Public API Documentation**

We’ve given our **public API documentation** a full refresh — making it easier than ever for your teams and developers to find exactly what they need.

<Check>
  **What's New?**

  - **Cleaner, modern layout** for faster navigation.
  - **Improved organization** of endpoints and examples.
  - **Fully mobile-friendly**, so you can browse on the go.
  - **Streamlined search** to help you quickly locate the details you’re looking for.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Address 2 Is Now Searchable**

We’ve fixed an issue where searching by terms in **Address 2**—including full or partial phrases—did not return results in the customer account.

Searches now include Address 2 fields, allowing Latchel and Property Manager users to successfully search using Address 2—even with partial matches—which results in more consistent and accurate property search results across your entire portfolio!

2. **Optional Email Field Can Now Be Cleared**

We’ve fixed an issue in **Maintenance Communication Settings** where users were unable to clear the “Additional, Specific Email Address (optional)” field and could only replace it with another address.

With this update, **Latchel and Property Manager users can now fully remove the optional email field**, restoring full flexibility and ensuring communication settings can be adjusted exactly as needed.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Enhanced Outbound Communication for Emergency Work Orders**

We’ve made an important update to ensure property managers never miss critical information during emergency work orders.

<Check>
  **What's New?**\
  \
  If we can’t reach your escalation contacts by phone during an emergency, **we’ll now send an SMS immediately**. This applies to both:

  - **Initial notifications** when the emergency begins
  - **Follow-up updates** if additional outreach is needed
</Check>

Each scenario now includes clear SMS templates to ensure fast, consistent communication.

This update helps guarantee timely alerts and smoother coordination during urgent situations.

2. **Clearer Process for Identifying Recall Work Orders**

We’ve updated our internal workflow to ensure recall work orders are handled with greater clarity, consistency, and visibility.

<Check>
  **What's New?**

  - **All recalls now get their own work order.**\
    Our team will always create a new work order for a recall and label it with “(RECALL)” for easy tracking.
  - **Better organization and traceability.**\
    Both the original work order and the recall will be added to a shared project, ensuring full visibility and smoother coordination.
</Check>

These updates help ensure recall issues are identified quickly, handled accurately, and tracked cleanly from start to finish.

### **Special Announcements**

1. **Expanded Lockout Benefit Coverage**

We’re excited to share that our **\$50 Lockout Reimbursement Benefit** just got even better!

Residents are now eligible for reimbursement not only for traditional lockout services, but also for:

- **Rekeying costs**
- **Key replacement**
- **Key fob replacement**

This expanded coverage provides greater flexibility, reduces out-of-pocket expenses, and ensures residents get the help they need—fast.

2. **Recurring Work Orders (Beta Coming Soon)!**

We’re excited to share that our team is working on a new solution that many of you have asked for: **automating recurring work orders**!

This upcoming feature aims to help you set repeat maintenance tasks on a schedule, without having to recreate them manually each time.

<Check>
  **Why It Matters**

  - Save time: No more recreating the same recurring tasks every month.
  - Better consistency: Ensure routine maintenance never slips through the cracks.
  - Smarter workflows: Your feedback in the beta will directly influence how we design the final version.
