### **New Features**

**Setting Emergency Expectations with Service Providers**

Clearer standards are now in place for how emergency work orders are scheduled, priced, and billed.

Emergency pricing and higher emergency budgets are intended for **same-day or within-24-hour responses only**. When an emergency appointment is deferred, missed, or rescheduled beyond that window, the visit is treated as **standard (non-emergency)** for pricing and budget—unless the Property Manager explicitly approves otherwise.

To support this, our Ops team processes have been updated and new service-provider messaging has been added for emergency work orders scheduled more than 24 hours out. This messaging clearly states:

- The visit will be treated as non-emergency for pricing and budget, and
- Service providers must contact Latchel before exceeding the approved amount.

These updates help ensure consistent expectations, accurate billing, and fewer pricing disputes across emergency work orders.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Task Assignment Notifications**

We’ve resolved an issue where email notifications were not being sent when tasks were assigned by a Property Manager to another team member.

Task assignment emails now send as expected, ensuring assigned users are notified right away when a new task is created—regardless of who created it!

2. **Clearing Unread Messages**

A bug prevented old messages from being cleared for some Property Managers.

When system messages were added after older conversations, Property Managers did not always have the option to close those conversations—causing old or unread messages from prior users to carry over.

That behavior has been corrected. Conversations can now always be closed, allowing unread messages to be cleared so new team members can start with a clean inbox!

3. **Future-Scheduled Tasks in the Feed**

Tasks scheduled for a future date were appearing in the activity feed before their scheduled time.

Tasks now stay hidden from the feed until they pass their **“Scheduled For”** timestamp, ensuring the feed reflects only work that’s ready to be acted on.

This keeps task prioritization clear and the feed aligned with day-to-day workflows. **Preview the feed view by visiting:**
