### New Features

1. **Inspection Lists**

We’re excited to introduce a powerful new feature in Latchel—Custom Inspection Lists\! Now, you can build and complete tailored inspection checklists directly within Latchel, making property inspections smoother and more efficient than ever.

With this feature, you can: 

- Create move-in, move-out, seasonal maintenance, and other inspection Lists
- Customize templates to fit your unique processes 
- Ensure consistency across all your properties 
- Keep inspection records organized in one place

Easily track progress, attach photos, and flag follow-up tasks—all from a mobile-friendly interface designed for fieldwork. While this feature is currently in beta for select users, we’re rolling out improvements based on feedback and will soon expand access to all customers.

2. **Improved Quote Approval Notifications for Service Providers**

We’ve enhanced work order approval notifications to provide clearer details when an estimate is approved. Now, service providers will see whether the approval is for dispatching a new job or an increased budget amount.

Previously, scheduling reminders didn’t specify if an estimate was approved or highlight the new budget. With this update, notifications will clearly state the approved amount, eliminating confusion and ensuring service providers have the right information upfront.

This improvement helps streamline scheduling and keeps budgets transparent\!

3. **New Latchel Data Sync Features\!**

The Latchel Data Sync **(**[**version 3.1.1**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/latchel-data-sync/cefobanegfgmcneibgdbcjbegnnoafob)**)** has a few powerful enhancements to give you more control and transparency over your data synchronization.

### **Resolved Bugs**

1. **Latchel Data Sync Now Keeps Disabled Properties Disabled**

We’ve fixed an issue with the Latchel Data Sync where previously disabled properties were being re-enabled during synchronization. Now, any property you disable in Latchel will **stay disabled** even when the sync runs—ensuring your unit count remains accurate.

This fix helps maintain data integrity and ensures your portfolio stays up to date without unwanted changes.

### **Key Process Changes**

1. **Freezing Conditions: No-Heat & Lockout Situations**

We've updated our **Troubleshooting Processes** based on recent feedback regarding no-heat issues and lockouts in freezing conditions. These changes ensure resident safety remains the top priority.

<Check>
  **What's Changing:**

  - **No de-escalation for temporary heating solutions –** Space heaters or fireplaces allow an appointment to be deferred overnight, but the issue will remain active since prolonged low temperatures pose a risk. 
  - **Emergency habitability for lockouts in freezing conditions** – If a resident is locked out with no alternative shelter available, it will now be treated as an emergency habitability concern and prioritized accordingly.
</Check>

These updates help us respond more effectively to urgent situations and provide better support to residents.

2. **Handling Police Requests in Emergency Situations**

We've updated our [**Property Damaging and Extreme Habitability Situations**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/Emergency-Escalations-Property-Damaging-and-Extreme-Habitability-Situations) to clarify the steps for handling police requests for tenant contact information during active threat situations (e.g., gunman, fire, medical emergency).

<Check>
  **What's Changing:**

  - **No direct sharing of tenant data** – Officers will be informed that we cannot share tenant data directly. 
  - [**Escalation to Property Manager**](/s/topic/0TO5e000000h9wqGAA/How-to-Update-Your-Escalation-Contacts) – We will notify the Property Manager’s escalation team about the situation. 
  - **Alternative Communication** – Property Managers will be advised to contact the police directly for any tenant data-related needs.
</Check>

These updates ensure we handle sensitive situations responsibly while maintaining clear communication with all parties involved.
